FYI 50% chance I will be driving to Texas on the 13th, returning on the 19th or 20th. I can continue to take work/inspections thru the 12th, including the weekend, and will be able to upload while gone as I will be taking the laptop. Go/no go decision will be made on the 9th. Or 5:00 a.m. on the 13th as some of my friends think. Shooting match to determine the junior travel team for the 2021 upcoming World Cups, etc.  Obviously I'm no junior but it is open for us old timers also. The 2021 Tokyo team members will be there too. The link will give you an example of what it is. My best period was leading to the 2000 Olympics. I was officially invited to the team tryouts, but that was a long time ago. In a galaxy far, far away.

02/11/2020; EMAIL FROM TOM: Hello Kirk, Just a quick update on me, after being in UCSF for 2 weeks, they told me they would only do a non-evasive operation on me and that that would have no guarantee it would work or they could do everything. I was let out last week and am home the rest of this week. I will be going to John Muir for open heart surgery on 2/18/20 for 3 buy pass's and 2 heart valve replacements,  they say I will be in the hospital for about 10 to 12 days and then maybe to rehab for 2 to 3 weeks. I will let you know when I can be back to doing some work after about 5 to 6 weeks. Hope everything is fine with you and your family. Take care. (CH)

Hey Max I totally understand.  Just so you know what our dispatch team has to deal with, CSAA just changed their expectations to 100 free miles and we have been eating the other 50.  I tried every version of common sense but it was apparently wasted breath.  
If you update your fees by location we can match it up to the client and if they allow pre-negotiated remote fees we will send it based on your list. 
If it is CSAA when we can break even I send it anyway, but if we lose money I'll just send it back with an “I told you so” note and maybe they will stop being idiots. 
Thanks, Mike Torgerson

We will need to talk regarding the 50 free issue.
I do not do mileage any longer for several years now.
My area is very remote a lot & my remote fees are based on location, travel time  & road conditions.
My wear & tear on my vehicle, gas & tires are worth more than 10.00.
Please do not pre-approve my mileage based on 50 free as I will not accept the assignment based on that formula any longer.
Thanks, Max

 Kirk,
 As you know it's getting harder and harder every day to send work to IA's. IA's have created their own demise by not following guidelines or writing a proper estimate.  I believe we had problems with your appraiser Tony Huynh before and I thought we decided not to use his services again. The estimate on this file was so overwritten that we had to rewrite the sheet and get an agreed price with the shop. 
Your being paid to inspect, negotiate, photograph and write a fair and reasonable estimate. The estimate that Tony wrote was useless.  You should review this file, read our summary notes and take note to what we did. 
 David E Lawrence

NOTES:
10/20/21 AA File 2135641 - IA was assigned this file, and 2 days went by with no status and repeated requests and text for status. We had to re-assign; David Lawrence at AIG was furious the owner had not been contacted. I re-assigned to Gene Stevens, as he would inspect that day to help us. Melissa called after the file was re-assigned, stating she was in contact with the owner. I confirmed we had to re-assign because we were not getting a response from her. She responded by texting that she wanted to be taken off our list.

NOTES:
3/29/21 RR Spoke to JP and he took a full time job - If we need him to handle photos only he will only handle them for $60 and that's that!  He no longer has software and does not write any estimates anymore due to COVID
11/6/20 RR Sent email to JP to see if he is willing to start working with Kirk's and using CCC1.  Checking to see if he wants to work!
9/17/20 RR Sent JP the login infor for writing in Kirks CCC1  - But he refuses and wrote his file in Mitchell
8/7/20 RR Sent a final request as he use to be active
8/5/20 RR Sent email asking if he is still active
HATES getting left over work from David Martin, do not EVER let JP know if a file was previously Davids

To whom it may concern

I have been given another opportunity to go to work in a shop, and I have decided to do so, so that I can get a little bit of my life back.
Working 72 hours or 6 to 6 1/2 days a week is just too much any more.
This shop will be training me to work in the shop, unlike the last time I decided to do this. 
I am giving notice that as of Monday, November 12, 2018, I will no longer be accepting new assignments.
I will continue to do supplements for 1 month, however, I will not be able to do re-inspections.

It has been a great learning experience working with your company and I appreciate everyone there.

Thank you,

This is to let you know that I will be going on a short vacation starting on August 9th thru August 13th and request no assignments from August 7th until August 10th.
Any assignments coming in on the 10th and 11th of August will be seen on Monday, August 14th.
I will not have Internet connection, so I will be unable to do supplements.
Looking forward to some time in the woods.

Subject: Covid-19 
HelloThis whole month has been a struggle for my whole family with a death in the family and now I just got tested for covid and the result is positive. I am showing some of the symptoms such as fever, cough, loss of smell/taste. Our family doctor advised me to stay at home for the next 14 days and hoping that rest will be enough. I will update everyone and if there are any changes in my condition.

Please don't send Mariano Encarna to shop for assignments, adjuster would not leave messages  and used profanity on phone @16:00 on 10-13-20. Owner didn't appreciate the rudeness of adjuster.

7/22/20 Gilbert has had his own CCC1 - he was confused as he bought it back when IAnet offered it and he thought he could only use it for IAnet - 
7/2/20-BS Improved quality rating to A Gilbert consistently turns in clean files, with all docs and labeled photos- hes responsive to my calls and attentive - wants to do a good job and always asks how to improve if there is an issue - deserves A quality rating. very few issues with his files ever. 
6/2/20 AA Email to Gilbert: Hi Gilbert, 
We have noticed that in your files, you use the highlighting option. Please refrain from doing this, as it causes confusion for our accounting department. We use that feature internally for billing purposes. Just a friendly reminder as well, please remember to label all photos. If you have any questions, please give us a call. 
Thank you for your help!

6/23/21 RR Benny unable to login to CCC1 - Per Tom with CCC1 need to deactivate his old username and make a new one - Updated new username in CCC1
3/4/21 RR Spoke to Benny and we updated his rates as he didn't  want to give 50 free miles to travel to Pleasanton, CA and I don't blame him.  The traffice is horrible.  We negotiated new rate structure for a $25 remote fee instead to help with the price of gas and traveling time
1/19/21 RR Benny updated his free miles to 50 free not 60 and the going irs rate of .58 rate was explained to him

Hello Don and Kirk
I honestly don't know who to send this email to as there has been so many changes within Kirk's staff and no introduction to us IA's in the field.
Unfortunately the time has come for me to make some changes with my daily work load with Kirk's Appraisal Service
With the changes that have been happening these last few months since Robert has left   -  Pay rate requests are now needed in the file as a status and an invoice needs to be submitted as well as having to sign a fee agreement for these pay request and coverage areas.   
Just recently I had 2 new assignments and 2 DOI in my queue that was it - So I took on my coverage with another company.   I was then informed that an IA from the Roseville area was helping me out with Lake and Mendocino County - I was shocked and kind of hurt as there was no call to me stating "" Hey Kelly we have brought on a new IA to help you out""  then I get a call or email asking if I could help out in my own area with some rush jobs due to this new IA not panning out..  Of course I do and get an ear full from many vehicle owners that have been waiting and asking why is it taking so long.  I don't throw anyone under the bus I just explain we have been overwhelmed with insurance claims and are doing the best we can with this area to get all the inspections done ASAP. 
My area is so remote as you both would know, I spend 90% of my day in my car 2015 Rav4 with 88,000 miles already then at my desk until very late to get the files uploaded - I always drive to the location to inspect the vehicle whether it's at a residence or shop.  I hear of IA's calling shops for photo's and estimates and getting paid the full rate and here I feel like I missed the request of a remote fee to Willits and I see on my statement I was paid $50.00 - Another, an RV in Redwood Valley paid $50.00 I thought these were a flat $100.00? and yes I submitted my invoice with both of these files  Another file in Willits I requested $85.00 due to the location and was paid $50.00 it was over an hour drive one way - this isn't worth my time honestly.  My point is I could spend numerous hours requesting these little issues that add up to hours of work that really isn't necessary.
I honestly don't have the time to request fees then submit an invoice and then get paid an amount less then I requested or thought I request months later, it's just exhausting and frustrating
All the other companies that I write for are all flat rates and they calculate the mileage for us so there is no issues.  All the other companies pay me from $50.00 to $70.00 just for Lake County plus mileage over 35 from some and 50 for others.
I feel go above and beyond to help out the vehicle owner from the time I inspect the vehicle with getting status from the insurance company because the adjuster hasn't called them yet to inform them of the next step now that we cannot email a copy of the estimate to the owner or shop with many of the insurance companies.  They end up calling us asking why the delays once again more work for us in the field or even after we have submitted the file.  This is besides the point of my email.
I'm just feeling the overwhelming disappointment of what I deal with in the field and some staff in the office not having a clue of the road's I drive in my area then demanding status on files using words such as ""Immediately"", ""Unacceptable"".  I just don't agree with using these words.
I will complete all the assignments in my queue as well as any supplements that come through because it is my responsibility to do so.
It really has been a great pleasure working with you - and so appreciate the opportunity to learn from you 
Thank you,
Kelly

12/10/17 TEXT FROM DEAN: I apologize for all the inconvenience that I have caused the last two weeks. I was hired by Hertz Corporation and they send me and another new hire to a class for the repairs Porsches and the new Corvettes which is required for the ASE certification that the company pays for. I can't respond during the day because I'm in class and give them that allows cell phones on during class. I start at 7 in the morning and I'm done at 5 in the evening. It's 2 hours traveling each way 4 hours round trip. I will update the files first thing in the morning. I have finals this week then I can return to a normal schedule. So that is what is going on and again I truly apologize I didn't mean for this to happen however Hertz was one that said the class was starting on the 29th yeah I had to attend it. So I will clean up my files and get everything in order. Please do not send me any assignments until everything is settled if you still want to utilize me I would need to know what my days off are so therefore I can forward that info to you. It has been a very hectic last two weeks not to mention extremely stressful for me and for you people as well. And again I extend my apologies

Keep open assignment count to 10 max & make sure Dean is 1st priority for USAA, then other clients if USAA volume is too low. RR 11/9/17

Hello Kirk's,  I am going back east to visit my grandkids and help my family move to another state, this will take several days..  I will be gone starting March 19 and will be back April 4, 2021.  I will still operate in the Eureka area and So. Oregon area and can write and upload these assignments remotely.  So I cannot accept any claims in the Monterey/Central Coast areas while I am gone, but will handle the other areas.  I will still access Claim Leader and can handle revisions/supplements while I am back east. Call me with any questions about this.  Thanks,  Dave Martin

Subject: Re: Assignment - Claim# 1004-00-5331.1 File#1836597 Status Update
Hi Angela,  I have told this reason many times before, but not to you, so it's OK to say this again. I feel we have good communication and I appreciate you and the work you do very much. You can't measure the remote fee required just by miles or linear distance.  There is a huge difference between going,  say 100 miles North or South on I-5 and going 100 miles on a narrow 2 lane mountainous road in No CA or Southern Oregon with unpredictable weather (right now snow);   2 completely different scenarios, the latter requiring much more time and safety precautions. So that is why each trip is planned out as to the route to be taken and time involved to arrive and return safely, hence the $200.00 remete fee to go to Happy Camp, CA. I go there because I love Kirk's and you guys treat me well (most of the time, lol), and I would challenge you to find another field appraiser around here that would consider going up there at all. This is serviced out of my Eureka office on this assignment, too dangerous from Oregon this time of year. It is a 3/4 days project there and back for this one assignment.  This applies to many areas in Humboldt, Del Norte, Trinity and other counties in CA or OR, that is just the reality on the ground.   I hope this helps explain the situation, a lot of thought goes into these remote fee calculations, not just random amounts I create on a whim.  Let me know if this helps. I appreciate all the work I get from Kirk's and I really like the people at Kirk's as well.   Thanks,  Dave Martin

I AM SENDING THIS EMAIL TO NOTIFY KIRK'S APPRAISAL  THAT I HAVE DECIDED STOP APPRAISING.  I AM HAVING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN MY LIFE.  THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION.  2 YEARS AGO, MY FATHER PASSED AWAY AND LEFT A RANCH THAT MY FAMILY MUST RUN.  UP TO THIS POINT MY BROTHER HAS RAN THE VINYARDS BUT FORTUNATELY HE HAS DECIDED TO GO COLLEGE AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN THE VINYARDS.  I WILL TAKE THE REST OF THIS WEEK TO INSPECT ANY FILES ASSIGNED TO ME AND UPLOAD THEM ACCORDINGLY.  I WILL ALSO FINALIZE ANY SUPPLEMENTS PENDING AT THIS TIME.  I WANT TO THANK YOU DON AND THE TEAM AT KIRKS APPRAISAL FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME.  I APPOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVINIENCE THIS MAY BRING TO YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I HAVE GIVEN THIS ALOT OF THOUGHT AND TRIED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. 
THANK YOU AGAIN , 

1/12/17 AB - Per Don, issue with Elias is resolved, he is not currently financially involved in a shop and is clear for work.

SPOKE WITH STEVE 4/26/17 & CAME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL KEEP HIM ACTIVATED FOR ASSIGNMENTS...FOR NOW RR.

***EMAIL FROM STEVE ON 4/25/17 RR***
I regret that I am turning in my resignation, as of today.I simply cannot make any money with the number of revisions requested of me, not warranted, but do to your demanding clients, in particular CSAA, than supplements, than revision of supplements and on and on it goes.

I can't spend 6-7 hours per $50.00 appraisal.
These revisions may fly in South Central Los Angeles, but not in the affluent area I cover, with ""High End"" cars and ""High End"" shops.
CSAA seems to be able to write a more accurate estimate than me, from 2000 miles away, off of photos.

I've spoken to Don, & though he's sympathetic, seems his hands are tied.
You told me when you started, you were going try and change the culture to try and make this industry fun again.I'm sure you've tried, but your at the mercy of demanding accounts, who I feel are in some cases unethical in not allowing shop to put in pre-accident condition, as the D.O.I demands.

These clients also don't see the big picture that while these revisions & supplements are going on for a few small dollar amounts, they're spending far more money on rental charges.

I still do want to compliment Don Mcguffin on his positive attitude, but he's forced to be a ""Good Soldier""

I felt it incumbent to ""Air My Feelings "", so if you lose other good, honest, qualified appraisers, you'll know why.

Warm Regards, Steve.

Good morning Ron/Tony,

I just wanted to update you on my situation and would also apologize in advance for any inconveniences. My family recently had someone pass away and put on me the burden to handle his estate and personal affairs. It is affecting my work performance and turn around time. I'm making funeral arrangements and contacting our relatives and friends.

I would like to request if Kirk's can not assign me any more assignments until I get this situation resolved. I will try my best to handle the current assignments and supplement for the files that I've done.

Thank you in advance,
Viet Nguyen

Sending you this email as official notice, effective immediately I will no longer be working as an Independent Contractor, accepting assignments from your company.  
I have been offered employment to return to my previous employer of 24 years.  They have not provided me any lead time, which prompted such short notice.  This is an opportunity to further enhance my future years towards retirement.
I have enjoyed our business relationship, and should anything change in the future, I would look forward working together again.

Effective 11/15/2016 Southwest Auto Appraisal will no longer be accepting assignments. Due to a sharp
decline in the amount of assignments I have received in the last 90 days I have
decided to close my business. Any assignment that was completed by Southwest
Auto Appraisal prior to 11/15/16 that has a supplement request will be reviewed
and completed by Southwest Auto Appraisal. Even though being an independent
adjuster for your company has been a pleasure, I cannot compete with larger
appraisal companies. I truly appreciate the work over the years and hope we can
one day resume our business relationship.

""Ron, 

I am not sure why the panic and attitude my friend…

The message was sent in order to attempt to provide info that may not come on the original assignment. Then, when you said that the number was not working, she asked if you had gotten the other number…and then you said you scheduled it.

Unless I am missing something, there does not appear to be an issue on this file…

Other than the fact that you are reacting like someone took a whiz in your Wheaties this morning…like I said before, Kajla is here to help move files along and assist you in getting what you need to complete the appraisal…No push…Just help. Ron and I are the pushers…Not literally, like drugs or anything…Anyway…

If you have some additional info or questions, give me a call…Otherwise, Looks like we are all good to proceed.

894135 10/3/17 RR: I don't think I want to cover this area anymore. It's a long way away from the rest of my coverage area and I rarely have anything else that far north. This is farther than Chowchilla and the I got hung out to dry on the last Chowchilla claim I went out on. I statused my appointment, showed up for it and got stood up by the vehicle owner. I wasted a lot of time and fuel, expenses that come out of my pocket on that claim, only to see it canceled and not recoup anything. I can't afford to lose money chasing these remote claims and if there's no guarantee on my end if/when an owner decides to no-show on me, it's not very attractive to me. If it was an area where I frequently had other claims or at least other work that was on the way, it would be easier to cover time/fuel costs, but that's not the case right now.

Good morning, I have not received any claims from you for over 4 month and I have No idea how to even do them anymore. I do know that they are a real pain having to enter your rates and prices every time and then the export and imports are not easy. After this long of time what I can do for you is do a Photos Only and a scope for 50.00 each and then attache them to this Email and send them to you and then you can do them in house and you can then do any supps that come in on them also. After this long I have other venders and am swamped with work rite now with the ones that give me work every week. 
 Please let me know if this is what you want or if you would like to re-assign them to another appraiser.
 Thank you

Old address:  83109 Singing Hills Ave  hello Kirk, thanks for taking my call today. As I mentioned  I am still doing auto appraisals in the Coachella Valley, property claims did not lead me in the direction I was aiming for. I am available to do your work in my area from Coachella to Palm Springs ""the Coachella valley"". My belief is that auto claims will get a surge back into business and i'm getting ready for it. Things are slow, so if one of your techs need me to be available to set up I am ready when they are.  thank you sincerely, Rich Perea

Remote & rather expensive appraiser. Uses Audatex.Hi Ron, ya know I got to thinking about another company, more software, more people monitoring work and I just don't need that nor the work. I am going to pass but thank you for thinking of me. I am overworked with 14 hour days and it never ends. I have turned down many small companies like yours that are hit and miss as it really screws with production and is my time consumption. I am passing on this opportunity and wish you well. 100 cars a month is plenty for me and will slowly reduce that down to one a day or less. Take care! Scott Seatvet​

I appreciated speaking with you . I will get you our coverage area asap but in the mean time send me all you want and if it somewhere I can not cover I will let you know . Normally we give 50 miles free then .55 cents a mile after that. Free mileage is negotiable a little bit. If it is within Houston, Harris County there is never a mileage charge . We go about 75 - 100 miles south and west of Houston. About 50 miles east of houston and 30 miles North of Houston.

Don,
On this file this assignment was sent over to the adjuster on 10/30/17, I got the incomplete estimate on November 7th and I am still waiting for the camper to be added.  I do not want this appraiser assigned to any of my files in the future, I am not sure why he is taking so long but this is not ok and my insured ended up paying for the repairs as I did not get the estimate/photos until afterwards.  I still do not have a completed estimate.  The insured is waiting for a call to provide  the pricing of the camper that he has already replaced, he also has the invoice for the camper that was stolen off his truck.  Can you have someone look into this please.
Thank you

8/4/17 RR: I am going to be working out of state until the claims quit rolling in. I am working in remote areas of Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas and New Mexico in which I am unable to get phone signal most of the time. I am still willing to handle supplements as they come in as I told Trish when she called me, but I am unable to complete re-inspections at this time only because I am not in the area. I apologize that I didn’t let you know that I would be out of the area, but it all came in like a whirlwind and I have had to be reactive instead of proactive to make things happen. If you have any more questions feel free to contact me as I am usually in the office on Tuesdays and Fridays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             7/24/2017 via file#850417  :Assignment Rejected

2/6/20 MT Jared answered Kirk last week and said he would take work again, but Mike found out he has been chasing storms from Ron Ragland at claim solutions and lying about the 3x MIA last year.  Use if you need to when he is local but pull fast and reassign if he doesn't turn right away.  He will not tell you when he leaves town. 

1/6/20 Jared was refusing work over his pay being turned off after his accident - Sarah and Mike have tried reaching NNA until we hear back

10/5/19 Jared answered text this weekend that he is available for work again, no idea what happened but suggest we give him a try and keep back up options in place. 

8/21/19 Jared had his computer and cell phone stolen and we covered him for weeks, he came back and proved it was worth it then completely went dark again a month later, I have called, texted, emailed and he sent one status on one file.  We had to desk and reassign all work.  Wondering if computer/cell was a story at this point. 

A++ when he is working NNA out of hope he comes back disable if no contact soon

Randy I need your help on this one clarifying what happened.  Client is not going to pay for your inspection.  8 day cycle time and a complete copy of a shop estimate for mechanical that is most likely UPD is how they see it.  Car is being torn down and our audit manager is now doing it after the CEO of Ameriprise called me on this.  
Is these something I don’t see in claim notes to help explain what happened?  We have had to turn you off new assignments until it is resolved.  MT

NOTES:
4/23/21 RR spoke to David this morning and he moved and his service provide didn't set up his internet and he just received 52 new assignments place on hold
10/23/20 RR Emailed David the Service Level reminder to label ALL photos Files 1812574 and 1812575
9/9/20 RR Sent David the TK login instructions
Bad at answering statuses - did answer my text on the missing scope after multiple status requests through system 
7/20/20 RR David is using his own CCC1 - He was using ours just for the desk writes for HE
7/9/20 AA - Spoke with David, and he is willing to do Crawford PO - work is slow. Also mentioned that for mileage he can go to Waco 1-2 times a week.
6-18-2020 RP email from David RE Crawford  Go ahead and take me off of the scope/photos for Crawford.  I'll do the Estimates, and T&E and crazy specialty requests.  But I can't cut my rates that low for so many files. Sorry.
10/20/2019 ZIP LIST RP Zips in CL and Vista
2/20/2020 RP DAVID AGREED TO $15 RE-KEYS AND $20 DESK WRITE
2/18/2020 RP David gave us a list of files that he was paid incorrectly on They would of had to be re-keyed over his pricing has stayed the same since 2017 full appraisals $65 was pd $60 PO $50 PD $40 will pay on each file where needed his rates in CL are correct.
9/25/19 CH Hola, got a random call from David on a file and we ended up discussing T&E work. Basically ‘if you can drive it, and they can wreck it, he can write for it'. May be a good guy to look at to help with our T&E work. He's also taking classes to get his property license. 
He also mentioned his dad is in the business and would have signed on with Kirk's but got in a tiff with Mr Ron Ragland, may be worth looking into. 
8/21/19 David has been a team player, covering remotes at reasonable rates, decent not great overall, if we had more work I would have tried Nebhut MVA only because work is intermittent 
5/13/19 MT SPoke to David says he now writes in the field so he can keep cycle time down, has 2 days with other companies.  3-year-old daughter at home makes it hard to work when he gets home. 
Will go out a 100 miles from dispatch location - 50 included negotiable

Just spoke with Gary. He was uploading a billing with each assignment that was getting ignored . We owe him $85.00 pack pay. 
Moving forward he needs 70.00 per Claim plus the tax rate of 7.875 = 5.51 = 75.51
He gives 50 miles free then .75 per mile after that. 
He is willing to do a large milage claim for a flat fee if he can work it in with anther claim , but only on a case by case basis

I will be out of States from 03/01/18 to 03/05/18,  taking my 15 year old son to York, Pennsylvania for Judo Championship, this is a very important National Championship, IJF & Cadet Pan American Team Trials.
From this trials USA Judo Olympic Comity will choose the champion  who will represent Team USA in Pan American Championship In Argentina on 2018 (over 16 different countries).
On 2016 My son was the Nation Champion, he was representing Team USA in Pan American Championship in Dominican republics, dedication and hard was the reason taking the First place.
Hopefully this year will be good for us.

Uploaded, I filled out the forms to the best of my ability. The TL form was foreign to me, I have never even heard of redbook. This client has way too many forms, goes over and beyond the standard appraisal fee. I will only handle as photos/scope in the future. Please, note that. Thank you.

He no longer owns/works for Family Appraisals. I believe he sold it. 
New owner is Dennis LaBlue; might be worth reaching out to him to introduce and get coverage for them. Nathan wasn't the best option for us – so maybe Dennis will offer some better service. Especially if we're bringing on Auto Owners.
Let me know if you need anything else from me 😊
Dennis LaBlue: (719) 290-3759
Also, I think a new profile should be created vs changing Nathans name in claim leader. I'll be deactivating Nathans profile to not cause confusion. 
Thank you, Courtney Herrero

Subject: Claims Volume Good morning, I hope this letter finds you in good spirits and good health.  It has been a few months since I have received any work from your team and I just want to let you know I am still available to handle claims for you here in Colorado.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Have a blessed day,
7/7/20-BS try not to use for liberty - poor quality files result in a lot of in house supps and or fixing -poor communication changed quality to d rating 
7/3/20 AA - Nathan responds initially, but delays file and he has to be hounded for uploads.
2/21/20 Spoke to Nathan and verified his address and updated his rates.  He has his own CCC1 He was willing and able to handle files for us.  I went over communication and statusing is important .  He asked about $190 that Kirks owes him not sure what for.  
*Good on initial assignments.   has tendencies to be slow  or ignores on supplements - cn 
1/7/20  SG  Per Gary at the shop he said that this appraiser, Nathan, just sends out someone to photograph and then he writes est. He said that this causes delay to the files as they never get enough photos or know what they are really doing. He said he was not happy about how they do things and how it ties up the claim process.
8/7/19 MT Last Choice   9/27/19 Move to NNA after we find a reliable option in the area. Can't handle his sup without 11 phone calls and texts. 
Multiple delays, not reliable during hail season, will occasionally answer a text msg, but does not status files.  He sat on our first Amerpirpise RV T&E file for over two weeks and sent in a full file on a photo only and lost us the chance to get the account. 
Good afternoon Susie, 
I am already set up as an appraiser for Kirk's.  I was understaffed this summer and we had some major struggles and I know I didn't come through for Kirks like I should have.  I have added two new field appraisers in the last 45 days and we have been able to reduce our file cycle time from 9 days per file to 3 or less.  I would like to have another opportunity to earn Kirk's business.  I appreciate your team's consideration and I look forward to the opportunity of re-establishing a trusted relationship.  
Best regards,

I will be on vacation March 4-12 and no available for new assignments or supplements.

via email 10/19/2017:Hi Courtney,
My name is Todd Bliek and I am rather new to Kirk's Appraisals. Trish Robinson said you may be able to help me. I am leaving town on Saturday, October 21 and will be returning on Saturday, October 28. I am not sure who I needed to tell so that I do not have any appraisals during that week. Would you be the correct person? I received a couple of new appraisals today and will try to get them set up before I leave but if that is not possible, I will reject them. 
Please let me know if you are not the correct person for me to relay this information to.
Thanks!
Todd

4/11/2023: PER EMIAL: After much thought and consideration, I have made the decision to dissolve my Adjusting Service effective April 30, 2023 to pursue other interests.  It has been a pleasure working with all of you. I will always value our relationships and will work diligently toward a seamless transition.  Perhaps we may reconnect in my new venture.

I can't drive, sit and barely can stand so you probably need to pull my assignments and supplements back. I'm sorry about this.""I'm hoping just a week. I'm going to stay down all week and hope give it a head start on healing. I'll keep you posted.""

2/12/2018: Hi Courtney, had a coughing attack yesterday and I  rebroke my rib. It's has me stuck in bed as I can't even sit-up. I think you better pull whatever work/supplements I have as it may be days before I can sit and do them. I'm very sorry about all this it's been on thing after the other and it's driving me crazy.

DISABLED 4/24/18 RR: Ron, I have my accounting manager giving me what was paid and what wasn’t. There has always been a lack of communication for some reason. I have never not statused a file, I have always written in ccc1, and have always handled my supplements with in 48 hrs. 

I did however put you guys on hold when I was told there was outstanding invoices not paid. As you know North Texas was hit by a few hailstorms as of late and so we have been completely swamped taking care of our partners who have been taking care of us. 

Either way I don’t mind sending you the unpaid assignment however you guys can keep it and pay someone to handle the supplements that you reassigned and we can part ways. 

I’ve never done work for a company who is not willing to negotiate a fee, or doesn’t have a designated paydate. It seems as if it’s just not a good fit. I wish you guys the best. 

Thank you,

NOTES:
8/19/20 From Kathy / Toby was in the hospital for 2 weeks  He was jumped and beaten up Will need to call him and see when he is available to work
7/21/20 AA - Had to re-assign 3 files: 1725554, 1720286 and 1720196 to Vicky to complete in-house. IA will be back charged for not completing requested revisions, such as scope sheet, header and labeling photos.
7/17/20 AA - I spoke with Toby Smith...I was not a happy camper with him. I asked him point blank when his files would be either revised or completed. He made it very clear that his priority was with other companies that he has T & E files with, because he will get paid $200-$300 each. I let him know that we have adjusters asking for completion on these, and with the weekend we need them done today. He said he is doing the best he can. I let him know I would let our audit team know. 
7/17/20 AA - Toby is not labeling his photos, and he wrote full estimate for a PO file (1720286). Was asked for revisions (1720196)  to label photos and use the correct forms, and stated in his notes that ""that's a lot of work for $60"". Currently has 4 files and none are submitted correctly.
1/18/20 MT - hey guys toby said his health is back to 100%.  I had a very frank conversation with him that his rating in our system is F and that he will tell us what we want to hear, not what we need to hear.  He didn't like it. I told him he could have one chance and if it doesn't;t go well we will have to take his software back. 
8/21/19 he is having some significant health issues but still moving files - need an A rated backup but keep him with enough work to stay active as long as he is keeping up - desk help if needed he has earned it 
8/9/19 Only reliable DFW option - he will always tell you what you want to hear, not what you need to know.  He lives with another appraiser and said he can keep up with whatever we have to keep sending.  I would watch closely. 
prioritize for arlington and south west side of dfw - he travels far well and is very generous on remote fees. 
5/8/19 - MT spoke to toby he has done last few assignments very well and wants to make amends over the tesla he sat on. He knows all types, but we must back him up on tesla's as it is not certified.  
04/29/19 Toby completed a file that I reassigned to him today as a Rush and he had it back to us within 4 hours. File # 1309312 Claim # 2674644
He has multiple problem files that have been deleted out of here - very low rated appraiser - mike torgerson  ",,,"2018-04-30 11:29:50",No,"76012,76120,76094,76096,76003,76004,76005,76007,76019,76013,76053,76006,76118,76011,76112,76040,76022,76010,76015,76095,76016,76014,76021,76155,76054,76117,76017,76103,76105,76039,76018,76119,76180,76034,75053,76182,76111,75050,76001,75051,76060,76148,76190,76137,76104,76166,76002,76101,76113,76121,76124,76130,76136,76147,76150,76161,76162,76163,76181,76185,76191,76192,76193,76195,76196,76197,76198,76199,75052,76102,75261,75061,75062,75060,76110,75014,75015,75016,75017,76115,76140,75038,76164,76099,76051,76106,76092,76248,76122,75054,76129,75249,76244,75236,76107,76134,76063,75211,75039,76131,75063,76114,76109,75116,75099,75212,76133,75104,75138,76177,75247,75233,75137,76127,75106,75019,76132,76123,75237,75220,76262,75208,76061,75235,75224,75234,75022,76097,76116,75260,76028,75229,75028,75207,76179,75209,76135,75027,75232,75219,75267,75342,75370,75006,75115,75242,75067,75011,75262,75263,75398,75202,75270,75358,76036,75221,75222,75250,75264,75265,75266,75275,75277,75283,75284,75285,75301,75303,75312,75313,75315,75320,75326,75336,75339,75354,75355,75356,75357,75359,75360,75367,75368,75371,75372,75373,75374,75376,75378,75379,75380,75381,75382,75389,75390,75391,75392,75393,75394,75395,75397,75201,76052,75203,75123,75204,75205,75029,75244,75226,75225,75057,75216,76108,75246,75007,75077,75215,75206,75001,75230,76084,76009,75223,75010,76065,75214,75241,75254,75210,75240,75251,75287,75134,76226,76247,76098,76126,75248,75231,75056,76058,75065,76071,75154,75243,75252,76210,75218,75227,75146,75238,75093,76020,75217,75228,75083,75085,75080,76059,75081,75141,75042,76008,76205,75024,75075,75167,75172,75041,75150,76031,76078,75149,75068,75034,75168,76202,76203,76204,76206,76207,76208,75180,75045,75046,75047,75049,75023,75253,75026,75086,76201,76259,75185,75187,76044,75044,76085,76064,75082,76035,76209,75040,76050,75025,76023,75043,75074,75033,75181,75182,75125,75094,75035,75030,75152,75048,75013,75088,75159,76082,76227,75089,76249,76086,75165,75002,75070,76049,75098,76087,76041,75078,76093,76033,75126,76073,76234,76266,76055,76485,75087,75101,75120,76636,75032,75069,75114,76670,76651,76267,76623,76258,76088,75166,75119,76487,75157,76048,75071,75009,76070,75132,75407,76439,76077,76426,76627,75173,75121,76246,75158,76272,75097,75160,75454,76066",,,Yes

07/01/22 CH Advised Brian he's ready for work. Handles regular auto, farm, h/e, RV, specialty - anything that moves
3/30/21 RR Jason has completed about 7 assignment for Crawford and Liberty so far this year 2021 and he is willing to travel.
1/20/21 RR Spoke to Jason and his address is not correct and I can not find any DocuSign paperwork updated his address and sent Kathy Reis email asking if she has it. Also he has completed a few files for us without any issues so I want to go over his ratings from July when he failed handling a Crawford assignment.  Sent new W-9 per Kathy's instructions.
12/4/20 RR Emailed Jason to see if he is active to receive assignments - He replied yes!
10/9/20 RR Reached out to Jason Taylor to see why he didn't complete the Crawford file below as we could really use his coverage.  Sent email asking him what happened and he said he didn't realize.  I explained all photos must be labeled and we must follow Crawfords guidelines to complete the scope sheets and scope sheets.  He said he is available. Giving him another chance as per previous interactions with him were good not sure what happened. Provided him with the new CCC1 instructions for writing in Kirk's CCC1 username etc.
7/3/20 AA - DO NOT USE - Had a rush file for Crawford 1712639, and he took the assignment, said no problem, and ended up emailing the unlabeled photos and no scope sheet for us to complete, stating he was too busy and didn't have his laptop with him to complete properly.
2/10/20 RLR Spoke to Jason and sent him his first Liberty assignment  1593245 and explained please handle as perfect as possible.  Sent him our Header info and instructions through outlook
1/30/20 RLR Spoke to Jason and updated his address/rates.  ** He has his own CCC1

For that $75 base rate, we will also cover the greater Savannah area as well as the greater Nashville area. They will call if mileage needed; 100 mile radius

NOTES:
4/20/21 RR Looking for coverage Dublin GA 31021 - Yes he covers with mileage
4/5/21 RR No number for Alyssa - Texted Doug and he responded he goes to Lyons, GA and updated Alyssa Register number 678-603-3516
3/16/21 RR Michelle called and will be leaving as she is pregnant and off to be a stay at home mom.  Tomorrow is her last day - She gave me the new contact for Doug is Alyssa@expertassetprotection.net no phone number is available for her. Brandi is training her and provided Brandi's phone number for now.
12/8/20 RR Phone call from Michelle asking for a password but went ahead and uploaded the estimate written in their CCC not Kirks tried to explain we have sent several messages to all appraisers all assignments need to be written in our CCC and she said that we will have to pay her to re-key it or we can wait until tomorrow to get this file completed 1847364 
11/24/20 RR Off for the holiday Thursday and Friday Nov 26 and27
10/5/20 RR Spoke to Michelle about handling Crawford assignments and they will keep handling as long as we get the mileage approved they will handle
10/1/20 AA - IA rejected file 1796015 - I asked the reason why, and he texted this response: We have rejected the assignment because, based on my discussion with my appraiser, he talked with Bob this morning and Bob was less than cordial. Honestly, that's enough for me to reject any assignment from y'all. I get $45 for a photo and scope sheet. I pay my appraiser $40 to go look at these vehicles. I pay my admin staff $10 to process them. I lose money every time I receive an assignment from Kirks appraisal. We rejected this one assignment, but if the future assignments are going to be Photos only with scope sheet, please do not send them our way. We will be OK without the work. Thank you so much
9/9/20 RR Sent email explaining CCC1 TK login and provide his username
8/19/20 RR Per Mike This is  a Bob error  He is ok to handle HEPO 
8/18/20 AA - Per Bob, no HE or HEPO due to file 1749572. Documentation and photos are horrible. Not able to tell if frame needs replacing.
2/4/20 RLR Updated email from michelle@expertassetprotection.net to Michelle_normand@yahoo.com
Spoke to Doug and Michelle and re set the base rate to $75 with a 100 mile radius.  Explained they will have to request mileage and it must be approved.  They now have CCC1 1/23/20 RLR
1/14/20 RLR working with Doug to see if he can handle other assignments. He is switching to CCC! this week and next week. Verified rates and address ** Handles the state of GA will send new zip codes for coverage that require remote fee. Discussed file handling expectations.
Doug has an office manager need to call Michelle for status 470-317-0975 rlr 1/6/2020 and appraiser is Brandy Scott 770-560-0049

NO HEPO WANTS FULL FEE **
Careful EXPENSIVE and He has a ""no go"" zip list? He rejects some close to his dispatch address. 
Audatex user - not super interested in other software 
Willing to travel and cover remote areas for fee- has other appraisers can access does HE 
4/26/21 RR Spoke to Alex and he will not handle HEPO. Only full assignments at T&E - His email to Angela - These are coming through as full assignments in Claim Leader. If the wrong person get that assignment, and goes out and completes it submitting a full assignment, you may be in some trouble when they come for their pay. I rejected this assignment in CL. I cannot do HE scopes at this rate. I am competing against myself with current clients. I thought the first one was just an emergency favor you guys needed a fill in for since it said “rus”h. I am sorry. Happy to negotiate T&E or full assignments, but I am losing money at this rate.
3/24/21 RR Spoke to Alex and he travels to Panama City FL from January - March asked if we could set up this address as a DND and he said yes.  Added DND for Alex 421 Jenks Ave, Panama City FL 32401/POB 935, Panama City FL 32402
11/10/19 MT Alex confirmed his rates and coverage and the ability to work.  Expensive but within reason if good.  
11/9/19 mt - he took a Crawford PO and asked for an update on fees - mike sent an email confirming waiting on a response 
9/12/19 LM and sent text asking if available for work to cover a HE claim for Sedgwick

NOTES:
6/24/21 AA - Dave stated Randy will be on vacation for the next week or so - placing on NNA until he returns.
11/18/20 RR Spoke to David Martin and Randy wants everything to go through David 
11/18/20 RR Angela received a message from David Martin to transfer two of Randy's assignment over to him because he writes the estimates.  I emailed Randy and asked him to confirm if he is working directly with us or for David Martin still.
11/9/20 RR Spoke to Randy and he said to send assignments to him directly. Verified his rates - He didn't realize David was on vacation so we can send assignments to him directly now.  The best way to get in contact with me is by cell  541 890 9423. 
11/3/20 MT spoke to Randy he is active and good to go, sounded like he wanted to go direct with us but I didn't engage in the convo, if Dave Martin goes offline reach out to Randy direct.  He does not go that far north on I5 and doesn't know anyone in that rea any more that does 
DND Profile - Randy Schmoll works directly for Dave Martin; any work in Randy's area (see cities/zips below) assign to Dave Martin, he will assign to Randy directly.

NOTES:
4/16/21 AA - File 1946834 - IA refused to do revision to label photos and complete appraisal report. Rhonda contacted, and he stated that what he did was good enough, he wasn't going to do it, and to not pay him for the file, that he didn't care. DO NOT USE.
12/9/20 RR Email from Roman refusing to help us with a supplement that isn't his File 1815590 - All this is the initial appraisers duties. There is no reason to hand it off it to me. He wrote the initial and he is responsible for the final and all forms etc. I was told yesterday that you guys needed eyes on this file. I out eyes on it. Showed up at shop and documented everything. Handing Kidd others work to me is simply not right. File is complete on my end. Please contact initial appraiser to handle his duties. 
Sent from my iPhone and he sent another message - From: ROMAN AVETISYAN Sent: Wednesday, December 9, 2020 2:39 PM To: Service Kirks Subject: Re: Kirk's Appraisal Service File # 1815590 - Re-opened for Revision I always do my job as assigned. This here is not my job. Whoever is assigning and reassigning needs to do it correctly and not throw things my way that belong to someone else. Nothing will work this way. There's no air heads here. Thank you Sent from my iPhone
11/9/20 RR Roman's response - Hi Rhonda, sure I can do that. I'll just write the estimates myself in ccc and we call it a day. Works? I replied yes and activated him again
11/9/20 RR LVM and sent follow up email to see if Roman is interested in handling PO and possible if needed we can rekey Mitchell estimates.  Per Mike T. we need his coverage.
File # 1814375 - did not do anything requested and blew off working for us, would re-use with caution
10/23/20 RR Email from Roman The system doesn't work for me. I have already completed the estimate and submitted it in Mitchell. The estimate is done. It is perfect. I can not use CCC1. If you guys can not accept a perfect and accurate estimate then go ahead and use somebody else. No problem.  He will not complete his estimate in CCC1 - My email to Roman - Hello Roman,
I'm following up from the voice message I just left you!  Do you remember when we set up your CCC1?  You just need to login with your username and the password we gave you!  I can help you if you want.  You can call me anytime so we can send more assignments your way.  File  1814375 Put him on NNA to see if he cools off 
9/9/20 RR Sent emai asking if he installed CCC1 - Yes he has CCC1 installed
9/2/20 RR Sent Roman the Kirk's  CCC1 license info to install and to call us for his credentials
9/1/20 RR Spoke to Roman as he does not have CCC1 and he is not willing to pay for it - asked if I could send him Kirk's account info to send and he said ok (he was argumentive at first)  I had to explained we really need him to work with us
07/30/20 MT Roman still there and willing only getting 2 assignments a week will leave the industry soon if things don't pick up
Spoke with Roman, he is willing to travel if need be to make money right now and is being a good team player. - AF 05/21/20

Subject: RE: Assignment - Claim# TH212683-001 File#1929979 Status Update
I am sorry I will not be able to complete this in a timely manner.
I just went to the doctor yesterday and have strep throat.  I will not be working until the beginning of next week.
Thank you for the assignment but you will need to send it to another appraiser.
Eric Johnson 
2/9/21 RR Email response from Eric - I am doing well.  Hope you are as well. Yes , you can reactivate me as of 2/12/21. Eric Johnson 
Owner - Wolverine Appraisal
2/8/21 RR Emailed Eric to see if he is coming back or not
8/27/20 RR Eric is doing well but would like to hold off on assignments for now as he may be going to Louisiana.  He asked about the cost of CCC1 I told him to click the link and check it out.  He is willing to do CAT claims if needed in LA
8/26/20 RR Kathy asked me to reach out to Eric and see if he would like DD for payments instead of mailing checks, Sent email to Eric to see how he is doing and when he will be available.
8/12/20 AA - Eric emailed asking to be placed on hold for the next 2 weeks; he has tested positive for COVID-19.
2/6/20 RLR I go for cardiac rehab 3 days a week first thing in the a.m. including that following Friday, so I did not get your messages until after getting out of there.  I am happy to do work with you guys still.  Does not go to Performance Auto
1/31/20 RLR Eric is unresponsive had to reassign file 1582650 I believe he is upset because we do not pay T&E for HE PO See notes below  Placed him on a brief hold 
*Does not have software ** Photos ONLY ** He does not go to Performance Auto Collision, Alpharetta, GA 01/27/20 RLR
1/29/20 RLR Received email from Eric My normal charges for Heavy Equipment are time and expense $65 hr plus mileage at 57.5 cents per.  it will be a 2.0 to 3.0 hour fee depending upon extend of damage and how long I have to deal with the shop.
Removed the HEPO from his claim type and let him know we do not pay time and expense for photos only See file 1579624

1/28/20 TH Spoke with Eric about HE and photos only. He is an experienced HE appraiser but does not have software and does not want to write sheets. He can and will do HE photos only but will require at least $60.00 per file and wants more. I believe he is a good photos only option.  Tony H

1/3/2020 RLR Eric requested a rate increase to $50 for photos/scope sheets - updated fees  He has been handling Crawford Photos only 1/24/20 RLR

Subject: death in family
Hi Angela, 
Am sad to have to share the news I just got that we lost a very close family member my beloved father in law and grandfather to my sons .  We have a funeral tomorrow and we will need family time to grieve and heal. 
As such, please hold off on sending any new assignments, we will finish up the open assigns that are scheduled and already dispatched as best we can over the next few days and will ask you to reassign unscheduled phone tags and other open items and assignments that we cannot see or otherwise finish up by early next week.  Will go through the queue and send you back any files that we will not be able to get to scheduled or see within the next few days.
As of now, will are planning to be back to work and ready for assignments on Monday, Oct 4 and thank you for the words of support that we have received from our friends in the industry who have been there to support us during this time, it is greatly appreciated.

10/13/20 RR Updated T&E to $50 per hour and they charge drive time - Email from Mike T. Rhonda, Henry has other appraisers and they cover all 5 boroughs.  Please get an address and update CL so they show on the map.
Also Henry does $50 an hour for T/E and uses drive time instead of mileage for T/E.  
Please make sure his fees and appraiser cards are updated appropriately.    
Thanks,
Mike Torgerson

4/30/21 AA - File 1957159 - Per Bob, do not use. IA did not inform that he was going over the 3 hours T&E, grossly overwrote the estimate, and when asked to complete the TL paperwork, texted that he was off until Monday (at 12:15pm) and could not complete until then. Will have to complete the file in-house.

My wife and I tested positive Friday for Covid 
Sent from my iPhone
6/28/21 RR Mike was in an accident this weekend and will be without a vehicle and then going on vacation 
5/24/21 AA - Spoke with the IA - and he will be on vacation from 5/28 - 6/7.
9/15/20 AA - Spoke with the IA - he will be out of town until 9/18.
7/6/20 AA - Spoke with the IA, and he is willing to go wherever we want him to as long as he is able to get mileage!
9/27/19 MT spoke to Mike, bringing on some help to ramp up work, actually bought his business from David Schuman, watch carefully at first, doesn't sound like he is hungry or needs the money and charges 60, wants 65.  Told him no problem if he could grab the area and dazzle with cycle time and appraisal quality.  Didn't sound like he was going to reset the industry.  Doesn't work weekends, wife is retiring, etc. 
 Has his own CCC1, knows Mitchell best, also knows audatex, had truck writer, iffy on specialty/heavy but game to learn or scope

NOTES:
8/6/20 RR Sent email asking if he is active now - Email response: I am currently heading to Colorado for an assignment and don't know when I will return.  I will let yall know as soon as I get back to DFW and am able to receive assignments again…  Thank you for keeping in touch!! Thank you,Josh Miller, 
6/22/20 RLR Josh is handling CAT claims in Colorado right now and will call back when he is available
5/29/20 AA Spoke with Josh to see if available. He is a storm chaser, and will not be back home until July. He said he would call when he is back.
1/6/20 MT 
Paid 245 for delays on claim File # 1495511 Claim # 2757190 Owner:
He called a shop a crook with the customer and Ameriprise on the line and it went to the Costco complaint department which makes Ameriprise very upset. 
Need an audit rating on any of his claims - his service is very questionable - if he can't write a good sheet move to D rating or NNA.

WHo put D- rating with no date or initials?

8/21/19 good option to have on standby with all the issues with DFW appraisers lately, southwest of dfw - he said he works with a group of appraisers in DFW and they could handle a lot of work (McKinney and Sherman areas, north Richland hills, everman.... we all travel for CAT work for storm season)
6/21/19 MT Spoke to josh, seems competent, does storm work, doesn't keep software after storm season but can write anything, was PO only for uploading photos, now does have audatex, know ccc well just don't have current license, 
first vspec looks good, he lost a day of cycletime trying to get a pdf coverter for some reason, but answered all communications and made a solid effort. 
knows auto and rv's - HE is slow no software

FYI taken 3 day weekend and will note be available for assignments on Friday March 26th. Back on Monday 29th. 
Also, taken a 2 week vacation, won't be available for any assignments starting Monday April 5th-16th.
Back on Monday April 19th. 
Please update my profile. 
Thank you.

3/4/21 RR Email from Wes regarding coverage and flat rate fees - got it.
well, the Lompoc thing...
I checked out the miles and it's not as far as I thought from my home address, so parts of it are only about 100 miles round trip.
50 miles inc
50 miles @ .58 cents= $29
so total would be $79. That's tough for me to leave my home area for over 2 hours. I know it sounds like a lot for 2 hours, but there is gas (not cheap now) and wear and tear on the vehicle. 
If you can get $105 for me to do a photo only assignment 'in Lompoc'
And $120 for going all the way out to Vandenberg Air Force Base in the way out outskirts of Lompoc. 
Then you can add Lompoc to my area. along with Buellton and Solvang, and Santa Ynez I can do those for $80. 
so... if you can just do these flat rates, I will make it work. 
$50: Santa Barbara, Goleta, Carpinteria, and Montecito.
$80: Buellton, Santa Ynez, Solvang
$105: Lompoc 93436
$120: Vandenburg 93437 (also, the extra $ is because you have extra time waiting at the gate, if you can't get the person to come out and meet you  in the parking lot. 
I can set up all my own appointments and will set up the appointment and do the inspection within 24 hours of the assignment, OTHERWISE I will document the claims web page w/updated statuses on the inspection date, or everyday if no contact is made.
3/3/21 RR Response from Kathy Reis no DocuSign needed.  Emailed Wes to see when he wants to be active - Response from Wes - Thank Rhonda!
great news!
So I am working on a personal project this week.
IF you don't mind waiting until Monday March 8th, that would be great!
BUT....hey, I'm a team player and IF you have some rush assignments in Santa Barbara area, then I will handle them starting tomorrow. 
But I would NOT take any 'out of town' work this week for Lompoc or Santa Maria or San Luis Obispo.
So, yea, Monday would be ideal.
just let me know.
3/3/21 RR Email from Wes Hi Rhonda!
Thanks for your enthusiastic greeting today! :)
It's always nice in all this social distancing protocol to hear in people's voices an intentionality to 'connect'. 
good job! I'm working on a project this afternoon but will go through all this very soon. it all look good.
Sincerely,

NOTES:
1/27/21 MT added $ sign only getting work at liefs and don't want to advertise 125 rate 
11/17/20 RR Spoke to Chad and reactivated him.  Only writes in Mitchell but we can use him for Photos only or emergency coverage.  I verified his information and rates - he still goes to Leif's 
02/04/2020 - only IA on our roster to inspect at Leifs; not much volume to get a good rating from (CH)
Chad is the only appraiser we know that goes in Liefs Bodyshop.  He is expensive but other local appraisers reject if it goes there for good reason.  Apparently the guy is over the top litigious.  Use Chad if needed to get an assignment done there but he is expensive and not sure he even wants more work from us locally.  Need to talk to him and update.
1/13/2020 RP Chad's full rate is $90 assignments at Liefs is $125

10/18/19 MT Tacoma is about the far end of his territory driving south. MVA since he is new and I'm not sure what he has been doing since SCA franchise sold.  Start slowly and monitor carefully.  
Susie found him he has a lot of experience SCA sold franchise he worked at so has been out of the business, he knows the job and expectations, didn't want to be given too much work to start ashe got back in to it but he used to have to do 10 a day and write then at night. 
We are doing 60 days of free CCC software to determine workload in his area and then evaluate.
Knows CCC and Audatex, does not know Mitchell but thinks he could learn easily.

12/7/21 - AA - Celina requested  rate increase to $70
9/22/20 RR Email from Celina I've been rehired by my last job this week that laid me off due to the covid layoffs.  I thought I would be able to balance working at the new job part time and continuing to do assignments for Kirks but the job is in South San Francisco and The assignments that I receive are too far away going in the opposite direction.  If there is help needed in Oakland or the San Francisco Area I can definitely still help.  Sorry for the last minute changes I wish I can be of more help I just don't want to burn myself out. Thank you  Celina

Subject: RE: Assignment - Claim# 80248239_1 File#1919492 Status Update
Hi Angela, So I will actually not be able to take that inspection. I actually accepted a staff position today and will no longer be working claims as an IA going forward. I wanted to thank you and everyone at Kirk's for the time we were able to work together and I will most certainly reach out in the future should my situation change. Thanks. Brian Robertson
1/4/21 RR Brian asked to update his auto/light truck fee from $65 to $70 - It has been updated
1/4/21 RR Email from Brian - I wanted to reach out and let you know that I am back available in the field from my 3mo paternity leave. My son started daycare today so I am available to start taking inspections again in the Denver area. Hope you and all the Kirk's staff had a nice holiday season and if you all need any updated documents from me for 2021 like business or adjuster license please let me know and I can send that over. Thanks. Brian Robertson
10/28/20 AA - Reason for Rejection: Appraiser is currently out of the field at home with newborn so unable to take new assignments at this time.
9/25/20 AA - Email from IA: Hi Angela, 
So I actually wont be able to take this assignment at Copart. I just found out this week and was going to call you all today but my son was supposed to start daycare next week but is now not starting until January as I guess a lot of things got moved around with Covid at the daycare. My wife goes back to work Monday so I am going to have to be out of the field  stay at home dad-ing for the next couple months, or until we can find another daycare or possibly a nanny. I can still take care of any supplements that may come through on my previous claims, but otherwise we will need to pause my dispatching for a bit. His daycare start date is Jan 4th but I am planning to reach out to my appraisal networks the week before so I can hopefully start making calls and getting things scheduled. Thanks.

1/7/2020 MT Found by  RLR LinkedIn 
Not familiar with CL has his own subscription to Audatex and CCC1
Does USAA for Nationwide Ins and a lot of Liberty Mutual for multiple companies  RLR
1/11/20 - updated fee agreement and asked for clarification of base areas if mileage is calculated from home office
i charge $0.55 per mile from 246 N St Paul St, Wichita, KS 67203.
i dont have a 2nd or 3rd base. its all from my base address. I average 380 miles a day, 6 days a week, year round. your dispatch can always just ask if ill go to a certain area. its a very rare that i cant accommodate one way or another.
i cover the north 1/3 of Oklahoma, from US HWY 412 to the north. includes larger cities like Woodward 73801 and Enid 73703. the far east point in OK is basically Red Rock,OK 74651 area. 
we go to the north tip of the Texas panhandle including the 79070 area.
Eastern Colorado out to LaJunta 81052 and Burlington 80807.
Southern 1/3 of Nebraska from North Platte 69101 east to Grand Island 68818. i do make the occasional trip to the Beatrice, NE 68310 area when needed.
4/5 of Kansas has daily coverage. I don't cover the Topeka, Lawrence or Kansas City Areas or north of there. I don't cover north of the following zips to through the north east south of KC:
666523, 66067, 66032, 66075. essentially you can omit the NE corner of Kansas and I do the rest. we go to Salina, Hays, Liberal, Dodge City, Colby, Garden City areas 2x a week.

NOTES:
11/21/22 SA Removed NNA  Appraiser was in poor health and has not recovered 
8/2/21 AA - Deactivating - IA is is poor heath
5/3/21 RR Dean called to say he is still in poor health and needs time off - He will cal us when he is ready to come back!  His cell number is 925-766-4668
4/20/21 RR Spoke to Dean he is ok - had two brain tumors and they found another in his colon. Ready to go back to work for Photos only for now just a few at a time
2/16/21 RR Received a strange call from Dean and he said he hit his head and didn't feel well, he was slurring and couldn't remember who he was talking to.  I asked him how he hit his head and he said he woke up with it .  His recording was interrupting our conversation and he kept saying he wasn't feeling well.  The call ended. I tried to call him back and sent a text and an email without a response.  I called Concord Police and asked them to make a welfare check. Called Kirk and explained **other phone number 925-889-9663
2/10/21 AA - File 1894445 - no response from IA on status - had to re-assign
2/9/21 AA - Please only use as a last resort. His files need to be constantly babysat, and late uploads are delaying files.
12/31/20 RR MT spoke to Dean and he is back with exceptions above
12/30/20 RR Dean called to let me know he no longer is accepting assignments from Kirk's due to the phone call he had with Bob - He was very upset.  He explained he has an appointment scheduled for today if we can try to call the owner and let him know Dean will not be able to complete it File # 1858288
12/29/20 RR Spoke to our appraiser Dean and he was not copying the shops estimate Bob misunderstood and I'm not happy with what notes were put into this appraiser profile as this is not true!  He will not handle any more USAA assignments and this will be sent to Mike for review.
12/29/20 AA - File 1859772 - Spoke with Bob regarding the file. The IA called yesterday, and stated to Bob that he was just going to copy the shop's estimate. Bob spoke to Rhonda about finding someone else in the area. We cannot have the IA copy the shop's estimate when USAA already has a copy of the shop's estimate, and denied it, wanting us to inspect and write one.
9/30/20 RR Sent follow up to Dean to make sure he has CCC1 installed as he has open assignments.
9/23/20 RR Dean is installing CCC1 today or over the weekend
9/22/20 RR Email Dean to see if he is interested and getting Kirk's CCC1 installed. Dean called back and asked me to send him the info!
5/22/20 - RLR - Spoke with Dean, and he is willing to do HEPO. Is unable to do RV, as he is not able to go on the roof. 
02/04/2020 - Dean called bob and complained about his estimate being changed in-house (come to find out, he did not read USAA guidelines); slow to status; skip if you can... but, he writes a good sheet - still MVA until we can get some better ratings from him (CH, BK) 
1/27/20 MT Spoke to Dean slow on initial calls and status - he asked for feedback then was flustered with the notice that he can't wait three days to schedule and status 
1/12/20 MT onboard - Susie referral USAA READY VERY EXPERIENCED WILL WORK WELL IF WE STAY WITHIN PREIMITERS SET WITHIN PROFILE HE WILL ANSWER HIS PHONE IF WITHIN CELL RANGE UNLESS PERFORMING AN INSPECTION CYCLE TIME GOOD

I'm out! Please pull me off your roster. I'll finish what I need to as far as supplements go but I'm over this password stuff. It burns up way too much time for one file bouncing back and forth and it seems like there is always a problem. BTW, finally got into CCC with yet another password...no estimate in there to even write the supplement.
06/29 CH - rejected assignment advising he was out of town, added NNA to profile.
6/1/21 RR Checking for coverage in Denver Colorado and he has completed a couple of assignments 1941286 4/21 1923563 3/21 1892007 2/21
2/5/21 RR Mike responded he is active has his own CCC1 sent TK instructions and credentials
2/5/21 RR File 1892007 was dispatched to this appraiser  - Since we haven't heard from him in a very long time I sent an email asking him if he is available to handle this file and if he needed his login information for CL and CCC1 - No notes show any new updates since June 2020
6/9/20 RLR Email from Mike - I haven't seen much from you guys, but wanted to let you know that I've relocated to  501 E 27th St, Greeley, CO 80631. I will still be handling any supplements that come over. Feel free to utilize me out here.  No more updates on coverage yet, I want to check out the area before I determine the area I want to cover.

2/9/21 RR Delayed files 1890661 and 1889926 
2/8/21 AA - Gor is taking way to much time with each file he does. He submits late, requires numerous phone calls because he is incapable of listening to direction. Use only if there is no other option.
2/1/21 RR Gor called to make sure we received the copy of his voided check and asked about work -
1/27/21 RR Received a picture of Voided check and forwarded to kathy
12/24/20 RR Gor's email response - Good morning Rhonda
Email is.      Gor82m@gmail.com
Sent from my iPhone
12/24/20 RR Emil from Kathy Reis - Gor Manukyan I noticed that he is marked (NNA MIA) wondering if it has anything to do with his email is incorrect in CL.  His email that he responded to today is 0107aic@gmail.com that is not what is in CL.  Sent email to Gor to verify the correct email we should use

Im streamling our business for profits…. Too many insurance companies are asking for a lot of “additional work” and don't want to pay for it.. I would think Kirks would have seen this and have “made adjustments” for all the total loss work… for the best interest of kirks and respect for the IA's they send this to.. Please remove us from  Mapfre insurance .. I did this one but not any more..  thank you for your business!

Angela… we are no longer doing photos and scope for Crawford.. We had a staff meeting this morning … This was discussed. Reason is low pay.. we pay our appraisers $40.00 and not much is left for my company and we can spend our time on other “good paying” claims.. We will do them but our fee will be $70.00 and nothing less. If Crawford is not willing to pay us this amount please remove us from photos and scopes from Crawford.. thank you for your business..

Have their own ccc but have not been using - need to get appraiser settled on usaa before asking for switch 
Ok Mike, here is what I am proposing to start this off.  
$115 flat rate for appraisals, no TLE but we will get you storage fees per day, the date it arrived at the shop, a copy of the tow bill, a picture of the rate board and status of repair.  I am unfamiliar with the picture of the rate board, so Todd may have a question on that, or he may know exactly what you mean!  He is copied on this and can comment.
40 miles free from Pueblo, CO or Colorado Springs CO or Denver, CO.  $.68/mile after that.   
For individual claims more than 75 miles from Pueblo, $40/hr drive time after the free miles.  
For claims more than 100 miles from Pueblo, we will discuss as needed.  
Mike, I want to be clear, this is an experiment and we want this experiment to work.  Todd does as well.  Talk to me on tough ones.  I would ask that you provide the name of someone Todd could call to discuss file requirements and how you would like to see things.  As it stands, this is for appraisal and photos only, but there may be some reporting of issues within the estimate.  No formal report.   I'll do what I can on my end to make it work.  I really do appreciate the conversation this morning, and more so the tone and honesty you brought to the table.  I hope we can make this work for all parties.

Hi Dana, We wanted to make you aware of some issues our Audit Team is having with the files submitted by your office. We just wanted to touch base with you on this one as an example:
Header was wrong, Crawford was listed as the insurance company, the deductible was not on the estimate, appraiser report was not correctly or completely filled out, NADA was missing, days to repair (yes even on a total loss) was not on the report, or in CCC1, one of the salvage bids was missing a dollar amount, file type was not correctly addressed and file was delayed due to this, Scans at 2 hours instead of .5 each for 1hr total, no AWF work file uploaded with the assignment.
Please ensure the appraisers are reading the insurance company guidelines when completing a file. This file had several issues that our Audit Team had to spend a lot of time fixing and unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened, it has been with every file. Thank you so much for your assistance on this, it is much appreciated! 
Thank you, 
Angela Allegree

5/21/21 RR Per email from Tara - New rate for HEPO  Per Tony, in the future scope, photos & id worksheets for heavy would be 125.00 in the lower and 140 in the upper.  We will due this in leu of time & expense for Kirks.  
Tara Serio  Forwarded to Mike and this is his response Mike Torgerson
1:35 PM seems like he is trying to get vspec for himself and cut us out - let him know that is more than we make and will have to reject them.  I wonder if he used to get them direct. 
3/16/21 RR Spoke to Tara and they charge $10 additional to go out of state (Ohio) .
2/5/21 RR Updated Photo only fee per email - Yes, we can handle photos only in Farmington hills.  Our normal fee for photos only in metro Detroit is 65.00
9/3/20 Tara was gone for the day so I emailed her the TK instructions
8/24/20 AA - File 1755045 - Crawford PO, and did not complete Crawford scope or label photos. Rhonda is reaching out to them; she has spoken with them before on the issue.
Very Experienced with Heavy $55 an hour and .70 a mile / $70 he Photo Scope 
Flat fee recreational vehicles boats, rv's, 4 wheelers etc. $180  check by county 
7/9/20  RLR Spoke with Tara and they are up and running - Please review the rates for both locations for PO fees for Auto/Light Truck, RVPO, HEPO ""The current contract with your company for rv/heavy is 85 in the upper and 70 in the lower.  For auto I think it would be fair to do 75 in the upper & 60 in the lower""

3/29/21 RR Email from Max - Unfortunately the time has come, I am currently too busy to keep track of claims from anyone other than the core companies that give me the most consistent work. I will have to ask to be taken off your roster for the time being. I really appreciate the opportunity and it was a pleasure to work with you all during the past few months. 
Hope you had a great weekend and best of luck this storm season!

Quality: Needs coaching on how to upload a full assignment to claimleader, how TK works, how to take relevant photos and not just take 100 photos with poor labels, general CL training as well doesn't seem like he knows what he is doing with everything and could use some guidance. I am not completely blaming the IA as I saw no notes in the file that anything was explained to him at all.

NOTES:
8/21/20 RR Distrubing email from Patrick - Declining to work for Kirk's As I no longer have a copy of the contract, I am unable to cite specific paragraphs. However, I'm sure if you go through the contract alongside my email, you'll see the areas of concern as glaring as I did. 

First, the contract used a form of the word “unauthorized”  written as “unauthorised”  that is atypical of American English. While this spelling is correct in areas of the British Commonwealth, this was a glaring error and gave me pause. It caused me to wonder where the KAS contract was written, or if it was copied and pasted together from contracts found on the World Wide Web. This oversight is problematic. 

Second, the phrasing of the sales tax clause was vague. While KAS may indeed pay applicable sales tax on any invoice, the contract was written as such that there would be no recourse if KAS arbitrarily chose to only pay the previously agreed upon fees leaving the burden to pay sales tax solely on the contractor. 

Third, while I do not take issue with the style of clothing mentioned in the ""dress code"" per se, a company cannot mandate an independent contractor to abide by any dress code. An independent contractor is not an employee. Although someone like myself would likely wear the style of clothing mentioned in the contract while on assignment, this clause cannot be in the contract. 

Fourth, I took extreme issue with the clause potentially requiring the contractor to provide a State Insurance Code and/or State Guidelines to KAS and its clients. Although this clause may never come into force, this is not the contractor's responsibility, and acting as such could potentially constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

Fifth, the recourse section of the contract is far too overreaching. While I somewhat understand the draconian policy KAS has in place to ensure work is done well, the contract was written as such that there is no recourse available to the contractor if KAS arbitrarily chose to process a chargeback incorrectly or without explanation. Further, while the contract itself potentially authorizes chargebacks, the direct deposit form only authorizes KAS to make additions — not subtractions — to a bank account. That oversight is problematic.

Sixth, KAS mandates that the contractor defend KAS well beyond the scope of any typical independent contractor agreement. The KAS contract states that if the contractor fails to defend KAS adequately (the extent and definition of which is ambiguous), it has the right to bill the contractor for attorney's fees and pass along any judgments rendered against KAS to the contractor. While I understand why KAS would require the contractor to obtain professional liability insurance in the event of negligence on the part of the contractor, I took issue with the vague expectation of legal defense.

Seventh, KAS requires the contractor to perform throughout the contract in such a way that is contradictory. I was able to identify the following rolls the contractor plays by signing this document: independent contractor, employee, and/or debtor (yes — debtor). This is incredibly problematic to see in a binding legal document. 

Eighth, because the contract you sent was a contract of adhesion, due to the seven areas of concern above I had not choice but to decline. 

Finally, before onboarding with any company, I always conduct research about that company on my own to determine if it is an organization with which I would like to have my name associated — Kirk's has negative reviews across then board from former clients and employees and on platforms like the Better Business Bureau and Google. 

For these reasons, and more, I've decided to pass on KAS. I hope this provides insight to you and your team, and I hope you have a nice weekend!

Sincerely,

11/25/20 RR Email from Jody - As you know I accepted an assignment to work Marine claims in August to try and gain some knowledge in that field to better service all our customers. I accepted it thinking it might last a few weeks, I was clearly mistaken. Due to the extremely active Hurricane season I'm currently still working Marine claims. Recently I was reassigned to work remotely (from home) doing clean up and believe this is coming to a close in the near future. I have gained a wealth of knowledge and a whole new understanding / respect for the inside part of claims handling that will allow me to offer better service.   
I would also like to take the time to Thank You and hope you and yours have a great holiday as well. Looking forward to working with you again ASAP.

email from Brad:
6-20-2022
Good Monday Morning, 
I hope my email finds you doing well this morning. 
This past week I was offered and accepted a position with a company that has changed my life in so many ways, IA PATH, as Director of Training.  Teaching/Training and encouraging people is something I'm very passionate about. It's what I did for 13 years before becoming an Independent Appraiser.  
As a part of accepting the position with IA PATH, I will still have the freedom to work as an IA but my time and claim load will be very minimal.  Moving forward, I will turn my focus more to heavy equipment claims/files rather than auto/light truck claims/files.  In order to reduce my daily claim load, I'm having to pause my working relationship with a great number of IA Firms.  
At this time, I will not be accepting/completing assignments/files from KIRK'S APPRAISAL SERVICES. 
I'm truly grateful for the opportunity I've had to work with your firm.  The work and trust you've extended to me has been an amazing blessing for me and my family.  
It is my hope that my work product & services have been an asset to your company.  I hope that if the need ever presents itself, I would have the opportunity to work with your firm once again.  
Thank you, 
Brad Fancher

I will not be receiving/completing any new assignments from today through Monday, 9-27-21. The claim load for my area is extremely high at this time. I am already completely scheduled for inspections for today through Monday. I've never had to make such a request and It's not my desire to request that I be turned off, but I feel it's the best thing to do at this time. If you have assignments that can be scheduled starting 9-28-21, I'm happy to accept them.

NOTES:
7/27/21 AA Emailed Nick to see if he is still in business and accepting assignments.
3/11/21 RR spoke to Nick and he may be ready by April 28, 2021
3/3/21 RR Nick is still working on keeping open will advise soon as he has his staff put back together
2/16/21 RR Emailed Nick to see  what he has decided to do
2/4/21 RR Nick emailed me the closing date is 2/15/2021
2/2/21 RR Email from Nick - As it stands now, I'll be forced to close after all these years on or about March 15th.  We received four assignments in January and no independent can survive with no more than that.  We've sent out information that we're adding commercial and residential property again to no avail.  I've lost my marketer and that was the last grasp so it looks like it's over.  I can't even find an auditor work from home situation, they all say I have too much experience and they couldn't pay me what I'd need, of course they never ask.  It's an age thing but they can't legally say that. Anyway, keep in touch and thanks for the work you were able to sent me.  Nick IASVS
1/12/21 RR Spoke to Nick and updated his coverage - Will only handle Photos Only, TX and LA all other are Not active at this time
12/7/20 RR Nick sent an email - I've just completed a tele-conference with the majority of my field people.  At this point, I feel it's in everybody's best interest that we handle photo only assignments going forward, at a revised rate of $60.00 per assignment.  Please advise if this is acceptable.  Will see what I can come up with.............ALL other states NNA 
11/23/20 RR Nick needs time off for the holidays
10/26/20 RR Nick called to let us know he is getting some riff from his appraisers on Crawford assignments - they feel they are asking way too much for the amount they get paid.  He is having a conference with his appraisers to discuss whether they want to keep handling Crawford for the amount of work that is involved to handle these.  A few were not at the given location and they had to track down the vehicles and with the requirements Crawford wants they aren't making enough money
1/0/13/20 RR Spoke with Nick and are opening up his coverage to start receiving assignments.  Sending him the CCC1 instructions w/credentials
10/5/20 RR Nick emailed me he went to his meeting this weekend to check on his appraisers AL, AR, MS and most of them had to quit due to this pandemic.  He is reorganizing his coverage

10/19/20 RR Don called and does not want to learn CCC1 As a business decision with his partners they do not want to handle in CCC1 and he will email me the one file 1807774 he has open which is a USAA supplement as a new assignment- He will upload photos to CL and email me the completed file.
10/14/20 RR Activating Don so he can start receiving assignments.
10/8/20 RR Don asked for the CCC1 installation credentials so he can install CCC1 - Sent him Kirk's credentials 
10/7/20 RR Don is very experienced - not sure he would be loyal as he has his own business LADCO Auto Inspection & Appraisal.  He uses Audatex and is willing to work with us using Kirk's CCC1 intallation requirements.  Does not know Claim Leader. If we need him to replace Abraham Garcia we will need to get him on board and CCC1 installed first.  He seemed hesitant at first but was willing to try us out.

Subject: Due to recent events
Hi Rhonda, Just reaching out to you, I spoke to your audit manager and due to his unprofessionalism, rude demeanor, and insulting manner in our conversation about my concerns with some legality issues and covering my own self with the appraisals im writing for kirk I have informed him that I am no longer going to be accepting assignments if that is how he is going to act and handle my files. I have had notes that are required by mass cmr to cover myself in the event of a lawsuit court appearance removed from my appraisals with no permission from me and sent off with my name and license number on them. Mass is very strict with this process hence the licensing situation and a full licensing board. I understand that the client wants things a specific way and have no problems fixing certain things, but when things get changed without my permission and sent off there is a huge issue. Throughout this conversation I was constantly ""wrong"" in this man's opinion and I was unable to even speak without being cut off rudely. I did not go through the mass licensing and schooling process to be told what mass cmr law is that I swore to and write to daily for someone with no license in this state, that has never done any work personally to tell me the law in my state and insult me with my ""demanding behavior"". I apologize that this has to end so abrupt but I cannot let this slide. This is a very serious manor in mass and I cannot let my name be on such files changed by unlicensed persons and will no longer accept any new files.
Thanks, Cody
2/18/21 AA Bob spoke with the IA on file 1897291. He was irate that we did a revision on the estimate per the adjuster's request. He demanded that he be given the authority to lock his estimates before sending to us. Bob explained that we are unable to do that due to billing, etc. He said that he refuses do any work for us unless he can lock his estimates, and said that what he writes is ""gospel"" and is not to be altered. He was very combative and not receptive to what Bob was trying to explain to him.  
12/7/20 RR Email from Cody Can handle all of MA - I will do all of my mass as of now, especially being slower, I'm centrally located so it is no big deal for me. In the future I will be looking to expand into new hampshire and some other surrounding states pending me able to get some good appraisers in those areas. If you need a list of the zip codes still let me know i'll get one together. As for when it gets busier I will be adding my help to your systems with you as we discussed!

Hello
I would like to be placed back online starting on 20th of December instead of waiting for the 27th of December. Start out slow if you can since I have to stretch and remember all of the things I gotta do for each of your companies. But I should be back in shape fairly quickly. 
My mom's funeral was last Friday and I got closure. I need to work to get my head concentrating on the future. Of course, I'm taking Christmas off😊

Effective immediately I will no longer be servicing your clients in the DFW area.  
With my current work load it is not possible to meet service level expectations and it would be best for both parties if I were to remove myself from your roster.
Please reassign any current or future claims that would otherwise have come to me.

Subject: Dave is Going Offline Effective 7/20/21
Good morning Angela, This is a heads up that I will be going offline on Tuesday 7/20/21.  I will be attending a celebration of life in upstate NY for my Dad who recently passed.  I can take claims for the next 24 hours but I want to be sure to be able to clear everything in my queue by this weekend.  I will be going back online on Monday, August the 9th.  As always thanks for all you do to support us IAs out in the field.
Have a great week,
6/15/21 RR Spoke to Dave and he active
6/9/21 RR Text from Dave Message:	Will reach out this evening. I can tell you it won't be until next week. I am booked solid the rest of this week. File 2006465 Over loaded
5/10/21 RR Dave is back and ready for assignments
5/3/21 RR Spoke to Dave and he is deployed handling CAT assignments until approximately 2 weeks - He will let us know when he is available.
4/29/21 RR Email from Dave Well… plans have changed.  My family was supposed to go camping this weekend but the weather does not look like it is going to cooperate.  I'm sharing that to say that effective immediately I am back online.  With the understanding that I am operating at full capacity due to the current volume of hail claims so I may have to schedule incoming claims out several days (depending on my work load on the day received).  
Thanks for all you do and have a good day,
P.S.  Absolutely NO USAA CLAIMS!!!
4/27/21 RR Dave called to let us know he will be taking some time off - He also wanted claification on status updates with hail as he will have to schedule them out and he is at least 6 days out.  He also mentioned he dislikes USAA files.
4/27/21 AA - File 1961948 - rejected - overwhelmed at this time
4/9/21 RR Email from Dave Effective immediately I am back online and available to help you close claims for your clients.- Sent email Waco got hit hard with claim and he wanted to let us know he is available.
4/1/21 RR Dave is out with an injury - He is scheduled for MRI on Monday 4/5
3/8/21 RR David is back and ready for assignments
3/3/21 RR Email from Dave - Thank you for the opportunity to help your client company.  Unfortunately, I am currently on an auto deployment and unable to handle this claim.  The length of my deployment is unknown at this time, however, I will be sure to reach out just as soon as the deployment concludes so that I can again help Kirk's Appraisal Service with daily auto claims.  Thanks and have a great day,

3/10/21 AA - Email to IA:
Hi Musa!
I want to thank you for being so responsive with your assignments. Your communication has been great! However, the Audit Team has asked me to reach out to you to give a few reminders:
1.	Please ensure you are taking the clearest, best photos you are able to. The Audit Team has had some trouble seeing damages clearly on your photos. 
2.	Please make sure you are writing the estimate from scratch, and not copying the shop's sheet. The client relies on us getting things accurate, and we do not want to submit an estimate that they were already given by the shop. 
3.	Please make sure you follow the insurance guidelines for all assignments. Every client requires different forms, and our Audit Team has had to complete these on your behalf. Each assignment has a tab marked “insurance company guidelines” that need to be followed or they will reject the assignment back for revisions. We want to impress them so we get more work, and we need to submit it correctly the very first time. 
Thank you so much for your help on these few things, it will really help our Audit Team expedite the file to the client, and ensures we keep them happy and get more assignments, which means more work for you! 😊

NOTES:
3/22/21 RR Hi Rhonda, 

We sincerely apologize for not providing more advanced notice, however, there has been a recent family development that requires us to temporarily suspend our operations in Iowa. That said, we can conduct inspections in North Texas for at least the next two weeks. Please update our claim radius to 100 (free) miles of ZIP Code 75020. We realize this is a much more competitive market, and we are willing to adjust our mileage as needed. 

Please reply with any questions.

NOTES:
8/3/21 AA - Spoke with the IA - she is still undergoing treatment and will not be active until at least next year - I told her to give us a call when things are better. 
8/2/21 AA - Emailed IA to see if she is still active - awaiting a response
4/30/21 RR Email from Karen - Dear Rhonda,
Now that I have gotten further along in my cancer treatment, I feel it necessary to suspend dispatch until further notice. While I may feel well enough at any given time to actually perform an inspection, I am concerned about turnaround time and supplements. 
As you know my son works with me.  Even though we have increased our free mileage to 100 miles one way and are with six IA forms we haven't generated enough income for him. He has taken a full-time position as an adjuster with a major insurance company here in North Texas.
For the above reasons and for both of our best interests, please put me on a medical dispatch suspension until further notice. If possible please keep me on your roster.
I have truly enjoyed everyone at Nationwide Appraisals and hope to work with you in the future.
3/22/21 RR Updated both her locations

3/8/21 RR Spoke with Paul and he insisted that the supplements for the state of MA are more work than the original estimate due to this being a licensed state they are regulated by.  Wanted to be paid for all supplements @ $45.  Explained we do not pay for supplements and agreed to include it in his appraisal fee.  Discussed with Mike T. and explained to Paul that he may not get any work due to the high fee but will keep him on for emergency purposes.

Subject: Chris Sawyer - Kentucky Update

I am sending this email to give a brief update on a few things.   First, I am finally fully recovered from COVID and am back to 100% working capacity.    Second, most importantly I have hired someone to handle phone calls and scheduling, they will start Monday, October 4.  This will be a tremendous help in calling, scheduling and updating notes in the system to better serve you and the carrier.   
Lastly, I have had a few personal issues that I have let get the better of me, affecting my work ethic and my professionalism.  I have been an ass to put it bluntly and I do apologize.   I hope that I am given the opportunity to receive more work and thus the opportunity to provide excellent service.
Thank you!

Good afternoon,
I hope all is well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I have scheduled a much needed procedure for the beginning of September (9/1/21). Unfortunately, I am going to have to stop accepting assignments at this time in order to (hopefully) avoid having any supplements come in during my recovery. With this last year being completely shut down due to COVID I've had to put this procedure on hold as well. I certainly apologize for any inconvenience. Starting Monday October 4th I will be able and VERY excited to get back to work and begin accepting assignments again. 
Please let me know if I need to direct this email to another individual to ensure proper delivery. 
Thank you for your understanding.

5/6/21 RR Email from Megan going on CAT duty - I just wanted to follow up from our conversation yesterday. I have been deployed for CAT work starting Saturday 5/8/21. I will complete the inspection that is currently open to me (fiel #1972961) tomorrow morning and submit the estimate as well. However, I will not be able to accept any future assignments until further notice. I am uncertain as to how long this deployment will last, so I will shoot you an email or give you a call as soon as I get back so we can pick back up. I'm really looking forward to working more with you in the future.

Suject: Re: Still Active?
Hello Angela,
Yeah.  I am still active.  More active than I have ever been.  This summer has been absolutely crazy.  I am busier now than I am in the snowy, icy winter months.  I am sorry, I just don't have time for more work right now.   Thanks fr the invite, however.

6/9/21 RR Sent a final request to complete the on boarding - Response received and he is out of town will be back next week to complete the onboarding
5/11/21 RR Email to Ron to verify on boarding
4/28/21 RR Fast tracked this appraiser to cover Steve Nickel who is refusing to complete work properly.  I know Ron from IAnet days - His fees are high!  He is familiar with Claim Leader and has his own CCC1. Can handle any claim type. Does not go to Powells Auto Body in Blackfoot ID.  Also not willing to do training assignment

4/28/21 RR Spoke to Jeff Selmos - referral from Nick Largent.  LVM and no response. Researched LinkedIn and he is connected to Kirk so I asked Kirk to reach out to him and he called.  He does not know Claim Leader and no software as he is semi retired.  He is interested in handling photos only in the Salt Lake City Utah area.  He is experienced in all claim types.  Setting him up as Photos Only Appraiser.

Subject: Hello Mr. Mike! 
Just wanted to touch base with you and make sure everything is okay. I onboarded with Kirk's days before Rhonda Ring was let go and wanted to be sure my appointment with Kirk's is still valid and to also find out who I should be in contact with now. Also, when I onboarded with Kirk's I had not yet purchased CCCOne and was put down for PHOTOS only. I now have CCCOne and I am able to complete a full estimate if needed.
I'm still looking forward to working with Kirk's and hope to hear from you soon.
Thanks,  Terry Kolb  tdkadjustingllc@gmail.com
