These guidelines and procedures will help you provide the best possible service to our mutual customers. &nbsp; State laws and regulations supersede these guidelines and are to be observed in all cases. Exceptional circumstances may exist in which a guideline does not apply. In these situations, you will need to work with your assigned representative. &nbsp; All vendors shall make all possible efforts to maintain the confidentiality of any personally identifiable customer or employee information that may be received pursuant to the conduct of business. Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, birthdays, financial information and vehicle repair records. Additionally, the contents of these guidelines are not to be disclosed to a third party. &nbsp; Potential Conflicts of Interest You must avoid even the appearance of impropriety. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, assignments for your employee-owned vehicles and vehicles owned by relatives of your employees, management, or owners should be referred back for reassignment to a neutral third party. This list does not include all conflict situations. You are expected to contact your representative when these or any potential conflict or sensitive situations exist. &nbsp; Keys to Customer Service We are committed to providing superior service to our customers. We measure customer service based on the following areas, and we ask you to provide exceptional service in these areas as well: Courtesy and friendliness Customer Contact Specific Timeline Instructions &ndash; 24 hrs. from time of assignment Prompt inspection and completion of the assignment Promptness of returning calls and keeping the customer well informed from time of assignment through completion of the inspection Ability to answer questions Ability to explain the inspection process Offer options for receiving updates Update portal or adjuster via email or phone every 3 days after assignment made until Packet uploaded &nbsp; Service Level Expectations See IA Service Level Expectations attachment for General Expectations Notes &amp; File Documentation All notes are to be entered into the Notes tab in CCC ONE. Notes and documentation must be specific, factual, and appropriate. Please avoid subjective commentary when adding documentation to the file. Examples include: Initial Contact Documentation: Contact Date and Time: Name of contact/phone number: Inspection scheduled - Date, Time &amp; location: Appraiser full name and contact information (phone &amp; e-mail): Inspection Documentation: Gross Estimate total ($000.00) Repair or Total Loss: Photos were taken as required: The number of repair days: Were additional part searches required? If yes, list supplier and name/quote # Any additional notes: Additional Total Loss Documentation: Estimated Salvage Value: Verify Sales Tax Rate: Verify other applicable fees such as but not limited to license fees, transfer fees, etc. Supplement Documentation: Gross Supplement total ($000.00) Please issue payment to: Shop info including TIN # Supporting documentation including photos &amp; invoices attached (Y/N): Any additional notes: The following claim information is required to appear on every estimate. Claim number Date of loss Damage assessed by Inspection type (Independent Field) Type of loss (comprehensive, collision, liability) Deductible Inspection date Number of days for repair (4 total labor hours = 1 day of repair) Owner&rsquo;s name and address Owner&rsquo;s phone numbers VIN Year, make, and model Mileage Options Point(s) of impact Loss designation &ndash; properly coded &ldquo;repairable&rdquo; or &ldquo;total loss&rdquo;. Note: When a the vehicle originally thought to be repairable is later determined to be a total loss, you must go back and change the loss designation to a total loss. A CCC Basic Claim Information Form must be completed when the loss vehicle is flagged as a total loss or appears to be a borderline total loss. See total loss section. &nbsp; Labor Rates The local going labor rate for each inspection territory will be reflected on the estimate of record. Photo Guidelines Photo documentation must include a minimum of: Repairable: 10 photos showing Each corner of the loss vehicle &ndash; 4 photos Vehicle identification number (VIN ) &ndash; 1 photo Odometer (if not accessible, per oil change sticker or service document) &ndash; 1 photo License plate &ndash; 1 photo Area of damage &ndash; number of photos necessary to clearly represent the damage, support repair times and justify repair/replace decisions &ndash; 2 photos minimum, taken at different angles Prior damage (if present) Total Loss: Refer to Total Loss bullet point number two. Repair Approach Determine appropriate approach in the following order of priority: Repair damaged part if cost effective when compared to replacing the part. Factor required blending and R&amp;I into this determination. Where replacement is warranted, replace with alternative parts when applicable based on replacement parts usage guidelines beginning on the bottom of on page eight (8). Replace with an OEM parts. Glass Lesser of Salvage / Sublet / NAGS / OEM with the following restrictions: Recycled windshields should not be used. All other recycled glass is acceptable. Safelite is the vendor of choice. Call 877-664-8931 or go to safelite.com to obtain a quote. Any glass related recalibrations should be addressed per manufacturer guidelines. Unrelated Prior Damage When unrelated prior damage is observed it must be noted in CCC ONE under the Vehicle Tab as a Prior Damage Note. If the customer is claiming the damage is related to the loss the following steps must be taken: If the customer insists the damage is related explain that it will not be added to the estimate at this time and the information will be communicated to the insurance company to review further. Call the file handler to notify them of the situation. Upload all documentation as soon as possible so it is available for review. Written documentation must be professional and factual as it will become part of our claim file. Markups and Discounts All markups and discounts, including: parts discounts, sublet, recycled and remanufactured parts must be entered as a &ldquo;Line Markup&rdquo; in the estimate. Markup must not be included in the part price. Sublet charges should not exceed retail price after mark up. &nbsp; Refinish Paint and Materials Threshold The threshold for negotiations of paint and materials is $500 (excluding California), and should be considered a point at which to consider negotiations. Negotiations of paint and materials should be handled on a claim-by-claim basis and must be well documented in the claim file. &nbsp; Blending Blending may be applicable when a color match from one panel to another needs to be facilitated and it is determined to be the most appropriate and cost-effective method to accomplish this. Examples of situations where blending may not be necessary: When adjacent panels do not exist on the same sight plane: Due to various effects caused by additives, such as metallic, pearls, tinted clears, etc., the color may change depending on your viewing angle and lighting. Note that in some instances, such as the current generation Camaro&rsquo;s door to quarter panel, the panels on the same side of the vehicle may not be on the same sight plane. When existing paint color is a non-metallic color. These colors are typically easily matched, have a low number of color variances and are not as sensitive to spray techniques or temperature at time of application Interior panels (i.e. jambs, under hood, floors, rear body panels, core supports, etc.) When the adjacent panels are different substrates Example: quarter panel to plastic bumper cover When there is a pre-existing color match issue on the potential blend panel(s) When prior damage or conditions (i.e. rock chips, rust, peeling paint, etc.) exist on the potential blend panel(s) &nbsp; Refinish Within Panel Boundaries Depending on the size of the damage and the panel, it is often possible to blend the color within the same panel. Since the color blend is achieved and contained within the panel, this process negates the need to blend into the adjacent undamaged panels. This operation should be considered and negotiated for whenever applicable. Refinish within Panel Boundaries guidelines: Can and should be applied if applicable regardless of the number of panels being refinished. The operation should not be considered based on a formula or be qualified by a percentage of the panel being refinished. Any adjustment made to refinish labor must not exceed the system-generated full panel refinish and will generally not result in a labor allowance below the system generated blend labor. All damage entries where Refinish within Panel Boundaries is applied must have the corresponding remark, &ldquo;Refinish within Panel Boundaries, includes full clear&rdquo;. &nbsp; Partial Refinish The term Partial Refinish is used to describe a repaired panel that does not require the complete surface to be refinished. The most common examples would be where a clear break is present on a two-tone box side in which only one color needs to be applied. Clear coat of the entire panel may or may not be required. Partial Refinish Guidelines: Can and should be applied if applicable regardless of the number of panels being refinished. The operation should not be considered based on a formula or a percentage of the panel being refinished. Any adjustment made to refinish labor must not exceed the system-generated full panel refinish and will generally not result in a labor allowance below the system generated blend labor. All damage entries where Partial Refinish is applied must have the corresponding remark, &ldquo;Partial Refinish&rdquo;. &nbsp; Corrosion Protection Corrosion protection should not be added to the repair estimate when replacing a bolt-on sheet metal part. If a sheet metal replacement panel is welded, corrosion protection may be considered. Basic corrosion protection that is provided by the paint system and primer is an included refinish operation. Therefore, it should not be added to the repair estimate when replacing a bolt on sheet metal part. It is important to consider that during some repair processes the factory corrosion protection may be disturbed on a portion of the panel the repair facility will not be refinishing. The application of a product, equivalent to a factory E-coat, to bare metal is not included in either the refinish or panel replacement labor. If a sheet metal replacement panel is welded, corrosion protection should be considered. The anti-corrosion compounds used during panel replacement are typically wax or petroleum based, and applied inside any enclosed section(s) of structural members. Weld-through primer is considered a form of anti-corrosion compound that is included in the CCC refinishing procedures for welded panels. A manual (Sublet) line entry for corrosion protection, coded at a SM (sheet metal) rate, should be entered with a dollar figure. When applicable ‐ any application of labor must be reasonable and well documented. Undercoating/Rust Proofing To be used only if the specific parts were previously treated &nbsp; Replacement Parts Usage Estimators should consider all approved alternative part(s) and make reasonable attempts to locate the most appropriate, cost-effective part(s) compliant when writing a repair estimate. Estimators must use their best judgment when searching for and utilizing alternative parts. Factors such as pricing, time constraints, part quality, and number of suppliers, part location, and the cost-benefit analysis should be considered in their decisions. The outcome and the thought process behind the decision should be reasonably documented in the file. Recycled Parts Non-mechanical recycled parts have no year or mileage restriction. All recycled mechanical parts must be of the same year or newer. Engines and transmissions must also be of the same mileage or less. Recycled steering columns and seat assemblies may be used on vehicles. They may not be used if this part is mandated to be replaced with airbag deployment within the vehicle air bag matrix HNotes in CCC ONE. When using a recycled steering column all salvage airbag components and safety equipment must be removed from the customer&rsquo;s vehicle and reinstalled if undamaged or replaced with new OEM components. In the instance the customer&rsquo;s steering column is damaged and requires replacement, all components must be inspected upon removal for damages. If components are undamaged, we may install the old components onto the LKQ steering column. Recycled structural components are acceptable on unibody and full-frame estimates. The installation of two or more LKQ rail sections is not permitted in the repair of a vehicle. b. Full frame replacement should not be considered where state or local law requires title branding of the vehicle. With the exception of the following bullet points, recycled steering, brakes, airbags, seat belts, child safety seats, struts, shocks and suspension will not be utilized. Recycled drive shaft or drive axle may be used provided the wearable components are replaced in accordance with our part usage policy. Recycled cradles, trailing axles, axle housings, control arms, and knuckles/spindles may be used provided all wearable components are transferred from the original assembly if undamaged or replaced with new (OE or Aftermarket) or remanufactured components. Recycled windshields will not be used. All other recycled glass is acceptable. Recycled windshield-mounted eyesight/safety cameras and sensors are not allowed Recycled cameras (reverse, front facing, side, etc&hellip;) will not be used. &nbsp; Aftermarket Parts We guarantee that customers will be satisfied with fit, finish and corrosion resistance of aftermarket sheet metal and plastic parts specified in our vehicle repair estimates. This guarantee applies to the original repair for as long as the customer owns the vehicle. A certification, warranty, or guarantee must be provided by the part manufacturer/supplier and accompany the part. Only certified (CAPA, NSF, etc. ) or KeysIQ and LKQ Platinum Plus aftermarket parts may be utilized to replace exterior plastic (headlamps, tail lamps, side mirror housings, etc..), exterior sheet metal panels, crash parts, and radiator/core supports. These parts should be marked with the seal indicating the certification. No restriction on plastic parts not considered to be crash parts. Fender liners, grilles, fillers, moldings, skid plates, deflectors, etc.. All customers must be informed of the use of aftermarket parts included in the estimate before repairs begin. All state laws, requirements, and regulations must be met to secure written or verbal consent where applicable. We adhere to all state-specific restrictions and regulations governing the use of aftermarket parts. We will NOT: Write estimates using aftermarket structural components. Write estimates using aftermarket bumper reinforcement bars, bumper reinforcement components or welded in radiator supports on unibody vehicles. There is no restriction on foam bumper absorbers, bumper cover components (bumper cover clips, brackets, retainers, etc..) There is no restriction to bolt-on radiator supports. There is no restriction to full-frame vehicles with welded-in core supports which are not considered structural. Write estimates using aftermarket exterior plastic parts (headlamps, tail lamps, side mirror housings), body panels and bumper covers in the following situations: Advanced Policies: Current or previous model year with mileage less than or equal to 24,000 miles Classic Policies: Current Model Year and equal to or less than 12,000 miles Other Policies: Current Model Year and equal to or less than 12,000 miles No restriction on mechanical (suspension parts, water pumps, etc..) or hard parts (radiators, exhaust, etc..). No restriction on plastic parts not considered to be crash parts. Fender liners, grilles, fillers, moldings, skid plates, deflectors, etc. Non-certified aftermarket parts will be allowed when they are replacing a previously installed noncertified aftermarket part or at the request of the customer. Example: Non-certified fender replaced with non-certified fender In those instances when an OEM part is on a long backorder or discontinued or not available aftermarket and repairing the original part is not an option, the estimate should reflect the price quoted by the system. Parts Polices &ndash; Remanufactured Except for safety related or Supplemental Restraint Systems components, remanufactured parts are acceptable. &nbsp; Parts Policies- Gray Market Parts Gray Market OEM parts are manufactured according to specifications provided by the original vehicle manufacturer. They have been purchased from a foreign source that procured the part from foreign OEM authorized dealers and/or their subsidiaries. Certain OEM&rsquo;s do not recognize these parts as OEM parts as they are outside of their supply chains, recall processes, and warranties. Because there is no guarantee by the manufacturer or suppliers, gray market parts should not be considered a viable part option for repairs. There may be instances where exceptions to these part policies will be made based on the needs of the customer. These exceptions must be reasonable, well documented, and take into consideration customer safety, as well as comply with the terms of the insurance policy and state regulations and laws. &nbsp;Supplements Supplements will be handled in a timely manner and with the same diligence and proactive approach as the original inspection and estimate. All supplements must be completed in CCC ONE. Photos, invoices, etc. should be obtained to document and support the supplement. Estimates will contain the disclaimer that any and all supplements must have prior approval from the inspecting adjuster. The customer must be notified if the supplement will result in a change in the repair/replace decision(s) and the expected repair timeline or rental needs. Total Losses The major activities of the total loss valuation process include: A complete and accurate estimate of damages If a total loss is triggered, change the Primary Point of Impact as &ldquo;15 Total Loss&rdquo; in the Vehicle Tab in CCC ONE Conduct a detailed physical inspection of the loss vehicle in accordance with the current CCC Vehicle Condition Inspection Guidelines A minimum of 11 photos showing: Each corner of the loss vehicle &ndash; 4 photos Vehicle identification number (VIN ) &ndash; 1 photo Engine/Under-hood &ndash;1 photo Odometer (if not accessible, oil change sticker or service document) &ndash; 1 photo License plate &ndash; 1 photo Area of damage &ndash; number of photos necessary to clearly represent the damage &ndash; 2 photos minimum, taken at different angles Interior view-Driver&rsquo;s side frontal seating area, to include in the single photo the carpet, seat and dash areas. &ndash; 1 photo Headliner --1 photo Additional interior and exterior photos as necessary for prior damage and abnormal condition. The purpose of vehicle photos is to capture the condition of the vehicle and support the comments and CCC Valuescope ratings. Estimate Administration Requirements: The following inputs must be correct, as they directly impact the vehicle&rsquo;s value: VIN, Year, Make, Model, Transmission, Mileage, Options and Date of Loss. When available, the factory build sheet should always be run in CCC ONE. Mileage should be entered as &ldquo;Actual&rdquo; even when it is estimated based on invoices or other supporting documents. It is an expectation to obtain supporting documentation when an odometer reading is not able to be obtained, and the mileage is estimated from service records or other sources. Mileage should never be entered as &ldquo;Not Actual&rdquo; or &ldquo;Non Readable&rdquo;. Zero miles should never be used. Rate the vehicle condition relative to each CCC condition definition and provide vehicle specific comments within CCC Valuescope in the space provided for each category. Comments should include what the condition is, where the condition is located, and the size of the condition observed. Any unrelated prior damage written for that category is also documented here. Documentation must be clear and concise. An Unrelated Prior damage estimate is to be written whenever an observed condition falls below the parameters on the CCC Vehicle Condition Inspection Guidelines applicable to the loss vehicle. A complete and accurate UPD estimate needs to be written in accordance with industry standards taking into consideration all repair processes and alternative parts. Identify enhancements or after-market customizations. Collect available supporting documentation and enter appropriate information on the CCC Basic Claim Information Form. &nbsp; If anything in this document is contradicted by your state&rsquo;s law (including the Claim Practices Act, or other statutes/regulation or case law), the law of the state is to be followed. &nbsp; 06/03/21 AF","BILLING NOTES $120 / $75 / Approval / $85 hour Standard Auto / PO Auto Rate / Mileage/Remote Fee / HE Rate Mileage: request by emailing Adjuster and status Nugen Mileage request format example if needed: $41.25 Additional Fee Needed.

Important: AIG insures high-end clients. They expect platinum-level service! Please Remember: Use AIG Notes Form instead of the Claimleader report or Claim Summary! It is in the Form tab of the assignment page on Claimleader. A COMPLETE estimate is required, not requested, it is a requirement per AIG management. Be on time! Completed appraisals must be uploaded within 60 hrs. We have 72 hours total for you to complete the assignment, go thru KAS Audit &amp; upload it to AIG! Clean professional business attire/business casual (no blue jeans, shorts, t-shirts, or logo'd ball caps). If you receive a claim for a celebrity this is not an opportunity to ask for autographs, remember to remain professional.&nbsp; The appraiser should contact the KAS ACCOUNT MANAGER immediately if the insured's vehicle is not at a certified shop. AM then needs to call the adjuster and email David Lawrence. List all possible open items in AIG Notes Form. An agreed price must be reached with the shop. Shop Tax ID # must be listed on the estimate. All new OEM parts on the insured's vehicles. If you are unsure check the instructions of the assignment. Do everything possible to get issues resolved with the adjuster ASAP so the file is not elevated to David to be resolved. Appraisers are not to contact David Lawrence at AIG unless noted otherwise!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guidelines for AIG NEW OEM PARTS ON INSURED VEHICLES ONLY (does not apply to claimant repairs). If you are unsure check the instructions of the assignment. These are PREMIUM Insurance policy-holders. AIG stresses premium customer service. &nbsp;Handle Insureds with particular care. If at a shop, we ABSOLUTELY MUST reach an agreed estimate with the shop on insured repairs and note in the closing report with whom an agreement was reached.&nbsp; If a concession is required in order to reach an agreed estimate, add a separate line to your estimate for the concession and explain it in your closing report. NO BETTERMENT to be taken on insured losses (however betterment may apply to claimant repairs). Complete the AIG Summary Report! You can copy/paste it into your estimating software then print to pdf for upload into Claimleader. Include all shop info and Tax ID numbers on the estimate if inspected at a shop. Include ALL parts invoices, tow bills, sublet invoices, and any additional photos with supplements.&nbsp; Include towing in your estimates. If unable to include with supp, explain in closing report. Complete UPD estimate if significant damage. Closely follow guidelines (long expansions) provided by AIG for all additional costs and operations. Be sure to write misc paint operations like tint, mask, etc as BODY labor operations. Completed appraisals must be uploaded within 60 hrs. We have 72 hours total for you to complete the assignment, go thru KAS Audit &amp; upload to AIG!&nbsp; Complete a Recovered Theft Report for all recovered thefts. AIG does not allow for modified refinish times on repaired panels/parts. Make sure shops are factory-certified to work on high-end vehicles before any work is performed. Notify AIG if NOT factory-certified immediately. Set expectations: Contact the customer. Document the summary. Status the adjuster. Direct the repair facility Be proactive: Discuss the damages with the shop and the customer. Explain the repair and your thought process. Discuss tear downs Heavy equipment: See heavy equipment guidelines Documentation:&nbsp; Write a thorough summary report and describe the damages Take ownership: Be responsible for what you have written. Follow up with shops after the inspection and document Summary Report: Provide a thorough description of when you inspected the vehicle, what the damages are and document so anyone picking up the file can easily understand the damages and the photos Supplements: Take additional photos, document, and obtain invoices. Write the supplement in a timely manner Total losses, Vandalisms, Thefts, Fire, Floods, and Hail: Take an additional photograph, document charges, write the condition report, get the adjuster, or the MD manager involved. PHOTOS: Photos must match the estimate you have written. The assignment will be rejected if the photos are not clear or reflect the damages in your estimate. Photos must be labeled, clear, and include Keson rod measured photos of the damage. Please make sure to document all options on the vehicle with photos if you believe the vehicle could be a total loss, this is very important.&nbsp; CSO&nbsp;Assignments: Instructions from AIG Management When the assignment states the customer has the CSO policy, this means that the customer has the option to repair or not repair their vehicle when the estimate reaches 50% of the AGREED VALUE NOT THE ACV. &nbsp;For example; if you write an estimate for $10,000 and the AGREED VALUE is $20,000, then the customer has the option to choose to repair or not repair based on the AGREED VALUE. &nbsp;Once you reach 50% of the AGREED VALUE, inform the shop that you need to check coverage with the carrier and advise them not to order parts and don&rsquo;t do a tear down until instructed. Do not tell the shop about the 50% option, this is for our information only. &nbsp;Do not release the estimate and contact the adjuster or myself for guidance. If your estimate is at 40% with the CSO but you think maybe the supplement will put it over 50%, you need to call me. &nbsp;Please do not tag the vehicle as a total loss, it is repairable, but make sure your notes indicate the vehicle has reached the 50% threshold of the AGREED VALUE and look for guidance from our adjuster or myself. &nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t confuse this with vehicles that may be written at 50% but are considered a constructive total loss! Applies only to repairable vehicles If your estimate reaches 50% of the AGREED VALUE or close on repairable vehicles, do not leave an estimate copy with the shop and contact the adjuster. Direct the shop to not order parts or do not start any repairs or tear downs without our direction Do not discuss with the shop the policy terms for CSO Do not tag a vehicle as a total loss Document the estimate has reached the 50% of the AGREED VALUE based on the CSO policy Contact the adjuster or me for direction TOTAL LOSSES (75%Threshold) Write an estimate for unrelated damage (do not include typical wear and tear).&nbsp; Run the valuation in CCC1 under the total loss tab, make sure all the correct options are selected in the vehicle tab. Obtain all advance and storage charges on the vehicle. Contact claims rep with the above info including claim number. Leave a voicemail with info if unable to contact rep. Do not advise owners vehicles are totaled. AIG makes a determination once all docs are received. Include a note on storage fees in your closing report. Call Copart and obtain a Proquote salvage bid. 800-269-4885 then select option 2 &nbsp;Commercial Policies: Please follow Commercial Guidelines found in Claim Leader Forms for AIG. Policies allow for, and require documentation of sources attempted Aftermarket, Remanufactured, and LKQ parts. Total Losses for any commercial vehicle require VVS to be called in as noted in Commercial Guidelines: TOTAL LOSS:&nbsp; Report all potential total losses to the AIG file handler immediately.

Then please give your expert opinion of what you SPECULATE will happen at teardown or supplement especially your knowledge of local shops. For example: Based on this center rear impact with rear body pushed in and the buckle in the roof, the rails are both most likely damaged. This was not able to be observed in the initial inspection but could be 2-4 thousand in additional damage. We recommend a teardown before making a final underwriting decision.

CERTIFIED APPROVED VENDOR GUIDELINES UPDATED 4/23/18 RR ***PLEASE PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE ITEMS IN BOLD/UNDERLINED.*** 1. All estimates must be completed with the CLAIMSOLUTION HEADER. NO EXCEPTIONS! Attached are examples of the header for the various estimating platforms. If you don&rsquo;t know how to create a header, contact tech support for the platform you are using. The header must read EXACTLY as shown. 2. We will need your EMS, AWF, and MIE on every file so we can upload these assignments back to the insurance carrier. This step is extremely important. The EMS is a separate item from the AWF or the MIE. 3. A completed&nbsp; SUMMARY sheet stating what happened when inspecting the vehicle. Where was it inspected, did you speak to anyone, is a supplement expected, location of vehicle, description of damages. Please attempt to use the summary report located in your estimating system platform. If your not sure how to do this, please call, its important for the notes to be a part of the file. 4. PLEASE follow the Insurance Company Guidelines. We provide a copy with every assignment. Each carrier has different rules and requests that deal with parts usage, LKQ, AFTERMARKET, BETTERMENT, UPD DAMAGES and if SALVAGE BIDS are required. If the company guidelines aren&rsquo;t followed, the appropriate corrections will need to be made. If you do not receive a copy of the guidelines, please call and a copy will be provided. If you can&rsquo;t locate the guidelines, please call the office. 5. The correct claim number must be included on the estimate. This is NOT Claimsolution&rsquo;s file number. The correct claim number is listed on the assignment sheet. It must be entered exactly as listed. All spaces, dashes, letters etc. must be included in the claim number. Also the correct insurance company must also be listed. Claimsolution IS NOT an insurance company. 6. STATUS- STATUS- STATUS You need to keep us informed of what is happening on your assignments. We have clients contacting us daily sometimes hourly on what is happening with their assignments. You need to keep us informed daily, when you made contact with the owner, when is the appointment, are we waiting on parts, is the shop causing a delay etc. 7. The adjuster must be listed on the estimate. Claimsolution employees are NOT the adjuster. The adjuster is listed on the assignment sheet. If it is not listed then just list the Insurance Company as the adjuster. 8. If there is a deductible listed it must be on the estimate. This information is also listed on the assignment sheet. 9. All pertinent information of the vehicle must be listed:&nbsp;production date, color, interior color, options, odometer, etc. 10. Please review the claims remarks on the assignment sheet. It may contain additional information to help you with the assignment. i.e. where the damages are located, where the vehicle is located, additional phone numbers, if measurements are required, etc. 11. Please list the BODY SHOP information if available on the estimate. This information is required on the estimate, if provided. ALL shop information MUST be provided on ALL supplements. Please include the tax ID number. 12. If there are UPD damages then a UPD estimate must be completed. Please create any UPD estimates in the estimating program you are using, do not write separate estimates. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to do this contact us. 13. On total losses please complete a total loss form. These must be complete and accurate. The correct form must be completed based on the Clients request, CCC, Mitchell, Autosource, Autobid. If you do not have the correct form we can provide that to you. Email both of us, we will email the proper form back. Please complete the form electronically, no handwritten forms. 14. Supplements must include additional PHOTOS, INVOICES and proper documentation. Again, the complete shop info MUST be included on the estimate. 15. A complete set of PHOTOS showing all four corners, the VIN plate, the whole door VIN sticker, to show the production date, the odometer, the interior and all the damages including UPD. Photos should comply with the company&rsquo;s photo guidelines. A minimum of 12-15 photos is required, on all files. ALL photos need to be date/time stamped, several companies require this. 16. The odometer reading is required on all estimate. If for some reason the odometer reading is not available, a detailed explanation as to why not is required. This is a hot topic with several of our insurance carriers. 17. All windshield prices must come from Safelite. Include a note on how the quote was obtained, phone number, quote number, ect. Front and back glass can&rsquo;t be lkq/recycled. Please feel free to call at any time if you have a question, or require assistance with any of the above.

The proper application flows from a process which coordinates the appraiser&rsquo;s knowledge, training, expertise, sound judgment, compliance to industry standards and local, state, federal regulations. This format is not intended to cover all possible topics or circumstances. One of the most important elements of job performance is the ability of appraisers to recognize, address and handle the specific additional details of a claim which merit further consideration. In all cases, the file is to be properly documented.&nbsp; Contact and delivery&nbsp; 24 hour contact Estimates and supplements returned in 2.5 business days All estimates will be processed through the CCC portal All appraisers must represent the company appropriately All customers must be treated with respect and courtesy Do not leave a copy of an estimate with a customer or shop Any delay will be communicated immediately Any issues will be communicated immediately &nbsp;Non-OE Parts Only certified Non-OE crash parts may be utilized. Non-OEM parts may be used on all vehicles except current model year plus one. For example, in 2022, OEM would be utilized on all 2022 and 2021 vehicles. Horace Mann does not write for Non-OE radiator supports or bumper reinforcements. &nbsp;OEM Reconditioned/Remanufactured Parts (OEM) reconditioned/ remanufactured parts will be utilized when available, on all vehicles except current model year plus one. &nbsp;Recycled Parts Recycled parts will be utilized when available, on all vehicles except current model year plus one. Horace Mann does not allow the use of recycled steering or suspension components. Horace Mann does not allow the use of recycled air bag or SRS components. Recycled parts must be from the same year model or newer and, when applicable, the same mileage or less. Glass Replacement Horace Mann utilizes Safelite pricing on all glass replacement, unless the glass is not available through Safelite, or utilizing Safelite glass would void the OE warranty. Air Conditioning (A/C) Systems Refrigerant will be priced based on the capacity of the vehicle. Air Conditioning (A/C) refrigerant recovery will be paid when the refrigerant is still present in the system after the loss and it needs to be removed to do a repair or replace parts. Wheel Alignments&nbsp; Wheel alignments will be listed when the vehicle is hit on the tire or wheel, if the vehicle left the roadway, or if the damages are extensive enough to have moved the suspension mounting points on the vehicle. Also, whenever suspension components have been replaced. Alignments will be written at the going rate in the area and entered as a sublet item. Not as an hour amount at mechanical labor rate. BETTERMENT GUIDELINES 2022 **no betterment applies to A/M or LKQ parts** Engine/Trans: 5% per 10,000 miles after 50,000 miles, Max depreciation is 70% Steering/axles/hubs/Struts/Shocks:5% per 10,000 miles after 50,000 miles, Max depreciation is 70% Exhaust (excludes Aluminum or stainless steal):5% per 10,000 miles after 50,000 miles, Max depreciation is 70% Battery: The number of months in use, divided by the battery life expectancy in months Tires: Current tread depth used divided by tire as new tread depth. Ex: if the reading is 8/32, the formula is: 2/32nds used out of 10/32 = 2/32 or 20% Paint: only applies if all over paint job - refer to claims manager &nbsp;","bulk billing 1st of the month - all invoices emailed to iainvoices@horacemann.com mileage requests: 50 free miles, .75 per mile after",,,,Yes,"2019-10-13 19:20:49",115.00,75.00,75.00,85.00,150.00,85.00,0.75,15.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,145.00,0.00,,,,,,,,,,

The idea (as we understood it) was that they would then quickly pay us for all of those invoices with a blanket payment soon after we invoiced them. That has not turned out to be the case. Recently they have significantly reduced the volume of assignments to us (which you may have noticed as a recent slowdown in our assignments to you). With that reduction in work from them, we are less inclined now to advance payments for files on which they have not yet paid us than we were in the past. We'll keep working to get the remaining invoices paid. I just wanted to provide an update on the current status. Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

List sources for all alternate (non-OEM) parts on your estimate. New OEM OK if under 20k miles. Include an unrelated damage estimate if damage exists other than normal wear. A/V (stereo audio/visual) losses are generally handled by CIS.&nbsp; Leave&nbsp;costs open on est and refer to adjuster. Calculate hazardous waste at $0.25 per ref hr; 2.5 hr clear coat max. Apply betterment (50% Max) when applicable and explain calculation in an explanation line on estimate.&nbsp; Betterment on complete refinish should be applied to materials only, before tax. If the materials threshold is exceeded, explain why in the supp closing report. Note in your appraisal report that the owner was provided with the estimate/supplement (except on total losses) and NOTIFIED of each supplement.&nbsp; Also document HOW the supplement was provided (mail, fax, email, etc). &nbsp; All supplements must also include location and photo of updated mileage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also required are supp invoices.&nbsp;&nbsp;If unavailable, explain why in the closing report.&nbsp; Allow up to 24 hrs for the shop to provide if they have them available. Note in the report if the vehicle is drivable at the time of inspection and the number of days to repair. For California collision claims, we must check with the&nbsp;owner&nbsp;and note in the report whether or not a CAR SEAT was in use at the time of loss.&nbsp; If so, photo and describe in the report, however, DO NOT&nbsp;remove the seat from the vehicle. Always include a photo of the odometer (working or not)&nbsp;AND REGISTRATION&nbsp;(or note in the report why these are&nbsp;not included).

THE AFTERMARKET CRASH PARTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS ESTIMATE ARE WARRANTED BY THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF SUCH PARTS RATHER THAN THE MANUFACTURER OF YOUR VEHICLE.&rdquo; Additional Guidelines for Sagamore Insurance: Color sand and Buff is not an operation we pay for as the vehicle does not come from the factory with this operation completed. Betterment should be taken at 10% per year on complete vehicle paint jobs. Betterment should be taken on any wearable part that is replaced that would at some point require maintenance by the vehicle owner. Corrosion Protection should only be written when frame repair or welding operations are conducted.

This note shouldinclude the documentation to support the total loss decision.Types of AppraisalsThe independent appraiser should strive to write a cost-effective estimate that returns the damagedvehicle to pre-loss condition according to the terms of the policy contract. Pre-loss condition can bedefined as the comparable appearance and functionality of the property before the loss, withconsideration for normal wear and tear.Industry accepted procedures, as recommended by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) ororganizations such as I-CAR, CIC, ASE, and any applicable DOI requirements should be utilized in thedetermination of the proper repair. An appraiser should never consider repairs that may compromisethe vehicle or occupant safety.Initial AppraisalThe initial appraisal should identify any and all visible damages. The independent appraiser mayrequest a teardown from the repair facility prior to committing the estimate.Unrelated Prior Damage Appraisal (UPD)Unrelated Prior Damage (UPD) represents Collision and/or Comprehensive damages only.

On all repairable and total loss vehicles that containUnrelated Prior Damage a separate Unrelated Prior Damage estimate must be completed and uploadedas a PDF into ProcessClaims. The notes section in ProcessClaims should also contain documentationas to what Unrelated Damages were found and how much it will cost to repair the same.Example of Unrelated Prior Damage (UPD):&bull; The customer&rsquo;s vehicle has a 3 hour dent on the right fender from the current loss. The front right doorcontains a 4 hour dent from a previous loss. The estimate would be written to document the 3 hour dentto the right fender and a separate Unrelated Prior Damage estimate would be written and uploaded into ProcessClaims to document the damages to the right front door.Related Prior Damage Estimate (RPD)Related Prior Damage (RPD) represents Collision and/or Comprehensive Damages only. It does notaccount for normal wear and tear situations. Related prior damages are located on the same panels asthe loss related damages. The proximity of the related damage to the loss related damages has nobearing. All vehicles that contain Related Prior Damages must have a separate Related Prior Damageestimate completed and uploaded into ProcessClaims. The notes section in ProcessClaims shouldcontain documentation as to what Related Prior Damage was found and how much it will costs to repairthe same.Example of Related Prior Damage:&bull; The customer&rsquo;s vehicle has a 6 hour dent to the left quarter panel from the current loss. The leftquarter panel also contains an 8 hour dent from a previous accident. The estimate would be written todocument the total combined repair time of 14 hours needed to repair the left quarter panel. A separateRelated Prior Damage Estimate would be written to document the 8 hours needed to repair the leftquarter panel from the previous loss. Note that refinish time would be included on the estimate ofrecord only.

Documentation must include photographs, invoices, ordetailed comments.During a physical supplemental inspection, the appraiser should evaluate the quality and safetystandards of the work being performed. If the vehicle is not being repaired in accordance with theoriginal appraisal, the agreed cost of repairs is to be renegotiated to reflect the repair procedures andmethods used in the actual repair.

The original treaddepth is 11/32&rdquo;. At the time of inspection, the damaged tire&rsquo;s remaining tread depth is 3/32&rdquo;. The cost ofthe new tire is $110.00. How much Betterment should be deducted?Step 1: (11/32) - (3/32) = 8/32Step 2: (8/32) / (11/32) = 72.73%Step 3: (72.73%) x (110.00) = $80.00x4=$320.00For replacement of engines/transmissions.Betterment ProvisionBetterment shall be applied to engines and transmissions only when:(1) The engine/transmission is being replaced by an OEM engine/transmission; and(2) The engine/transmission being replaced has been in operation on that vehicle for at least 80,000miles.Betterment deduction shall be calculated on mileage in excess of 80,000 miles and shall be based on a150,000 mile life expectancy; provided however that a commercially reasonable expectancy could beused if the vehicle has been well maintained with no apparent problems.Calculation Step 1: (actual mileage over 80,000) / (150,000) = % of usageStep 2: (% of usage) x (cost of new engine or transmission) = Betterment deductionExample The Customer&rsquo;s engine at the time of the accident had 110,000 miles. The accident caused theengine to warrant replacement. An OEM engine was located for $3,000. How much Betterment should bededucted?Step 1: (110,000 &ndash; 80,000 = 30,000) / (150,000) = 20%Step 2: (20%) x (3,000) = $600Total Loss vs. RepairThe independent appraiser will consider rental, down time, open items, salvage potential, and unrelatedprior damage in the process of determining whether the vehicle should be recommended as a total loss.NADA should be used to determine ACV.As always state law takes precedence over these guidelines.Total Loss HandlingThere are three types of total losses:1. Constructive Total Loss - The vehicle ACV less salvage value equals or exceeds the cost to repair.2. Borderline Total Loss - The vehicle ACV less salvage value is close to or about the same as the costof repairs. In this case, the appraiser should consider the factors noted above to assist in making thecorrect fiduciary decision.3. Obvious Total Loss - There are only three conditions in which you can determine a vehicle an OTL: (1)complete burn, (2) complete strip, and (3) flood (salt water above the rocker and fresh water into thedash).NOTE: All estimates with the exception of OTL&rsquo;s must be written in its entirety to include all damages.Total Loss EvaluationThe CCC total loss evaluation form must be completed in detail at the time of inspection. The CCCevaluation is to be uploaded through Process Claims as a PDF attachment when the estimate issubmitted.Vehicle EquipmentIt is important to identify and document all vehicle options to ensure a fair and accurate evaluation.Special wheels, CD units, leather seats, and special packages often add to the vehicle value.Conversely, vehicles not equipped with air conditioning or with manual transmissions vs. automatic willprobably suffer a deduction in value.MileageThis area often has an influence on the vehicle value and should be identified and documentedaccordingly.Condition CodingThe vehicle must be rated or &ldquo;condition coded&rdquo; accurately in the following areas: Body, Paint,Mechanical, Tires, Interior and Glass. CCC&rsquo;s Condition Coding Guidelines explains this &ldquo;coding&rdquo;process by describing the circumstances necessary to code or rate an area of the vehicle per yourregion&rsquo;s condition rating guidelines. Appraisers should always have and refer to these Guidelines whennecessary.Theft InspectionsA recovered vehicle inspection is required and should include:1. Positive vehicle identification through multiple vins (dash vin vs door jamb)2. Point of entry or lack of it. Examples: comment on door locks, door skins, and window molding.3. Method of theft &ndash; positive start / steer / shift. Any damage to ignition, housing, or surrounding area?4. Any items/components missing or removed? If so how? Surgically neatly removed?5. Any unrelated prior property damage. Evident by: rust, cobb webs, different heights, etc.6. Any unusual documentation, observations or markings. Example: for sale sign, street racer,mechanical invoices, parts in passenger compartment, etc.7. Completion of the theft report. This report should be uploaded into Process Claims as a PDFattachment. If a copy of this report is needed please use the contact list below.Fraud:If the Appraiser suspects any type of fraud related to the claim they shouldemail or call the claims rep with the details regarding the same. No notes or opinions should beincluded in ProcessClaims.","Please send all payment status inquiries directly to our Billing Department: Invoices@NationwideAppraisals.net Do NOT attach your invoice in ClaimHub, they will not be processed.

Etc for any estimate where the vehicle is not in the shop, or where shop choice is not known and items are added at shop request in order to reach an agreed repair cost. Haz waste is okay as calculated in profile. Tint, mask for overspray, colorsand, corr protection, etc. MUST be written as BODY LABOR operations when allowed. Do Not Add Tow Bills to Estimate. Indicate them in your report, attach copies and upload with estimate/supplement but do not include in the cost of repairs Write with LKQ, A/M (Only Keystone CAPA/NSF Certified sheet Metal), and recon when available. Non-CAPA plastic parts are ok.&nbsp;Use&nbsp;OEM only for all safety-related parts including windshields and those listed as structural in the crash guide. We are ok to write LKQ suspension x-members, axle beams, axle assemblies, steering columns, wheels, and leaf-springs (when replaced in pairs). List sources for all alternate (non-OEM) parts on your estimate. New OEM OK if under 20k miles. Include an unrelated damage estimate if damage exists other than normal wear. A/V (stereo audio/visual) losses are generally handled by CIS.&nbsp; Leave&nbsp;costs open on est and refer to adjuster. Calculate hazardous waste at $0.25 per ref hr; 2.5 hr clear coat max. Apply betterment (50% Max) when applicable and explain calculation in an explanation line on estimate.&nbsp; Betterment on complete refinish should be applied to materials only, before tax. If the materials threshold is exceeded, explain why in the supp closing report. Note in your appraisal report that the owner was provided with the estimate/supplement (except on total losses) and NOTIFIED of each supplement.&nbsp; Also document HOW the supplement was provided (mail, fax, email, etc). &nbsp; All supplements must also include location and photo of updated mileage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also required are supp invoices.&nbsp;&nbsp;If unavailable, explain why in the closing report.&nbsp; Allow up to 24 hrs for the shop to provide if they have them available. Note in the report if the vehicle is drivable at the time of inspection and the number of days to repair. For California collision claims, we must check with the&nbsp;owner&nbsp;and note in the report whether or not a CAR SEAT was in use at the time of loss.&nbsp; If so, photo and describe in the report, however, DO NOT&nbsp;remove the seat from the vehicle. Always include a photo of the odometer (working or not)&nbsp;AND REGISTRATION&nbsp;(or note in the report why these are&nbsp;not included). If unable to document actual mileage (but other sources are available), include&nbsp;""True mileage is unknown""&nbsp;on estimates, supplements, and total loss forms. Also, explain how the mileage was approximated. Enter ""UNK"" (and reason) on all docs if there is no way to approximate. Need an agreed estimate whenever possible. &nbsp;Include in report&nbsp;name of shop estimator who agreed with estimate. Mark deployed airbags&nbsp;with the company abbreviation &ldquo;MAPFRE&rdquo; and date appraised. Also, mark along the top nearest the housing with a bold black marker and include a photo showing these markings were done.

Write only the damage you can see. Take photos of all damages written on your estimate. Watch for damage due to wear and tear or lack of maintenance. Look for betterment opportunities and document prior damage through UPD estimates. Consider repairing borderline damage before replacing damaged parts and negotiate once at shop. Consider partial refinish opportunities vs. full refinish utilizing the 18 inch rule or 1/3 rule. Any materials over the $350 threshold will need to be negotiated or invoiced.&nbsp; Consider panel refinish vs. blending adjacent panels once at shop. Vehicles over 12,000 miles and/or 1 year are eligible for AM, RECON, and LKQ parts. Do not consider LKQ or sublet markup until vehicle is at shop.&nbsp; When considering sublet markup, take into account list cost vs. shop cost. Do not consider R&amp;I or blend operations unless vehicle is at shop.&nbsp; Verify the shop actually performed these operations. Consider color tint vs. blend on faded paint. Consider frame time/unibody time only after the vehicle has been torn down and conjunctive repair time has been addressed. Floor pulls may be utilized in the field. Utilize glass.net price quote for glass and/or aftermarket glass vendor. Do not place towing on estimate. Towing will be paid with the initial/supplemental payment. Perform a cost analysis for take-off truck beds on any pickup with multiple panels needing to be replaced. When utilizing OEM parts, request a shop discount. Have vehicles torn down to expose hidden damage. Re-inspect supplemental damages. Include days to repair on your estimate. ALL revisions/corrections MUST be created and submitted as SUPPLEMENTS.&nbsp; &nbsp; State rates per area are below.

Customer complete address with contact information. Complete claim number. Vehicle make, model and year, complete VIN number, odometer reading, license plate, body style/trim, and all extra equipment. The vehicle condition described in detail, with a complete prior damage estimate for all pre-existing or unrelated damages by dollar amount on all total losses.&nbsp; &nbsp;Appraisal should be written in logical sequence, starting at the point of impact and working toward the end of damage.&nbsp; Describe the vehicle condition separately by interior, exterior, and engine compartment.&nbsp; This will prevent the missing of any damaged parts. Use any aftermarket glass service or Safelite for any glass replacement (see glass section of this document). No blend refinish allowed for vehicles not at a shop. Do not automatically put R&amp;I for refinish when painting unless the unit is at a shop that will perform the R&amp;I and work. Spot refinish of side panels should be figured when applicable. Paint Material should not exceed $350 (one-stage), $400 (two-stage), and $450 (three-stage) threshold and clear coat time should not exceed 2.5 hours. Deviations from these amounts may be considered on a case by case basis and the adjuster must approve anything additional with proper documentation. No grouping of items on the appraisal. Do not copy, rearrange or use a shop estimate in preparation of an appraisal.&nbsp; Do not list a tow bill on the estimate, obtain photos of the bill and upload.&nbsp; Some policies only cover a limited amount of towing. In some cases you must authorize a tear down to minimize supplemental potential or rule out a total loss. &nbsp;THIS DOES NOT AUTHORIZE A REPAIR. You must obtain an agreed cost of repairs with the body shop.&nbsp; Do not give a copy of your estimate to the shop or vehicle owner PHOTOS&nbsp; Only digital photographs will be accepted.

Absolutely no hazy, very light or very dark photos&nbsp; PARTS USAGEAll estimates will be written utilizing computerized systems with a current database to identify OEM and non-OEM parts. &nbsp;OEM Parts:Current model year and one model year old less than 12000 miles &ndash; use only OEM partsSafety itemsAirbag components and sensorsSeat belts Suspension parts Braking components Other safety critical parts &nbsp; LIKE-KIND-AND-QUALITY-PARTS:&nbsp; Recycled and aftermarket parts should be considered on vehicles two years old and older or on vehicles with more than 12000 miles. When used, the estimate must reflect recycled parts and the owner must be made aware of their use. &nbsp;LKQ parts must be utilized when appropriate. Be sure to list the name and phone number of the recycler. If LKQ parts are unavailable, utilize car-parts.com or list at least three recyclers called, with their phone numbers, name of the person to whom you spoke and a reference number when available. Allow a maximum mark-up of up to 25% over the cost on LKQ parts Trim time on LKQ parts: 4.0 max. Only applicable to LKQ parts which require cutting and trim to fit. Use reconditioned bumpers and rebuilt parts including generators, starters, carburetors, and certain other mechanical items. The repair of non-metallic bumpers is strongly recommended and do not overlook the possibility for appearance allowances on minor cosmetic bumper damage. &nbsp;QUALITY REPLACEMENT PARTS (AFTERMARKET):&nbsp; All Non-OEM sheet metal must be CAPA certified. Utilize aftermarket parts whenever possible for the following; Batteries Bumper/reinforcements Radiators and AC condensers Exhaust parts Wheels/Wheel covers Tires Lamp assemblies &nbsp; ***Items such as aftermarket body kits, permanently installed TV&rsquo;s, DVD&rsquo;s and other non-factory stereo equipment, bug shields, grille/brush guards, vent visors, running boards, bed liners, custom paint, and other additional equipment may not be covered by specific state policy. If you have a question about coverage for a specific part, please contact the adjuster for approval.***&nbsp; SPECIALTY SHOPS:&nbsp; Utilize specialty shops in cases for radios, convertible tops, interior trim and dash repair. &nbsp; FRAME AND UNIBODY REPAIR: Estimated time should be supported by data determined from the use of steel tapes, frame gauges, centering gauges and Datum Line book information to determine the extent of damage. FRAME PLACEMENT - Use of LKQ Frame Replacement when frame requires replacement. OEM Frame on current year model or newer with less than 12,000 miles. Wheel alignments should be allowed only when there is direct impact with the wheel or suspension or when there is misalignment of related parts such as frame repair. &nbsp;HAIL DAMAGE REPAIRS: Write all hail damaged vehicles to repair. Use PDR (Paint-less dent repair) whenever possible. Include R&amp;I for headliner and any other panels that may require access.&nbsp; Repair or replace any panel using the conventional method of repair when necessary. FLOOD DAMAGE: When writing flood damaged vehicles, it is the appraiser&rsquo;s job to use his/ her good judgment when making a decision to Repair or Total the vehicle. Use the scale of flood level 1 to 4 as guidelines. Take a closer look at any vehicle that has any electrical components or computers on the floor of the vehicle. Most of these types of vehicles are high line vehicles i.e. Lexus, Mercedes and so on. Document file with photos and a detailed appraisers report explaining why recommending the vehicle to be a Non-Repairable/Total Loss.&nbsp; SUPPLEMENTS: Open items should never be listed on the appraisal. However open items should be noted on the remarks section of the estimate. A supplement must be verified by personal inspection if applicable unless parts price differences only. Review and compare the repair invoice against the original appraisal to verify the supplemental damage. Take documented photos of supplemental damage, and have the shop save any damaged parts. TOTAL LOSSES: A complete itemized estimate will be completed on all vehicles to support the repair or determine the vehicle to be a total loss. Estimate must clearly identify a vehicle as a Total Loss. EClaim upload must be marked as Total Loss Complete prior damage estimate is also required, except on obvious total cases, such as total burn outs or train wrecks. A one line OTL can be utilized. A vehicle should not be considered a total loss until an estimate has been written to the point which justifies that the vehicle is a total loss. Use your state&rsquo;s Total Loss ACV threshold Obtain any tow or storage charges and vehicle location as of to date, do not include in the estimate, only in the documentation. On vehicles drawing storage charges, requires an immediate call to adjuster. Complete a detailed and accurate Mitchell Options sheet with all vehicle options while at the vehicle. Complete vehicle conditioning matrix at the vehicle. DO NOT instruct the owner that the vehicle will be a total loss; explain that you are using the information to get an accurate value of the vehicle to determine reparability.

Vehicles must be inspected within 24 hrs.&nbsp; Any delays in uploading your documents must be explained to the vehicle owner and noted in your file. Writing estimates on the spot is the preferred method for handling claims. Impacts causing significant damage affecting the overall underwriting condition of the vehicle should have an itemized unrelated prior damage estimate written with supporting photos. This damage should be documented in the notes back to the Claim Representative. A copy of the estimate is to be given to the customer and an explanation given as to what repairs have been estimated. The estimate must also be provided to the shop (noting in your report how these estimates were sent).&nbsp; Always tried to reach an agreed estimate with the shop and note accordingly in your report.

The vehicle's current model year or less than 20,000 miles will have OEM parts only. This includes glass and wheels. Aftermarket, reconditioned and LKQ parts can be considered on vehicles older than 1 model year but newer than 4 model years; and vehicles with more than 20,000 miles but less than 60,000 miles. &nbsp;Aftermarket sheet metal is not considered in this period. &nbsp;If aftermarket parts are utilized, they must be CAPA certified. &nbsp;Vehicles older than 4 model years or more than 60,000 miles are subject to the use of aftermarket, reconditioned and LKQ parts, including CAPA certified sheet metal. &nbsp;Auto-Owners allows the use of NAGS glass on any vehicle regardless of age or mileage. The NAGS glass must perform to OEM standards and specifications. As a rule, the pricing of all glass should be NAGS less than 40% on the part. &nbsp;Auto-Owners specifies OEM replacement parts in the following categories: Air Bag Components Brakes Seat Belts Steering Components (including tie rods) Steering Racks can be remanufactured in addition to OEM.

Release estimates to shops, reach agreed price with shop. Release estimate to vehicle owner. Appraiser must contact vehicle owner post inspection and give summary of repairs. Summary discussion must include the following when applicable: Betterment - Appearance Allowance Parts usage whether lkq/aftermarket or reman parts are utilized. Glass- Contact Safelite ask for Hanover price, used, oem, use lowest price. Must call supplier &amp; have quote # note on estimate body for LKQ parts. PARTS REPLACEMENT OPTIONS Alternative parts should only be considered in appropriate situations. If a structural part requires replacement, Recycled OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), Certified or parts that have been validated by a Third &ndash; Party for quality and performance should be considered. Structural parts include, but are not limited to, bumper reinforcements, energy absorbers, bumper brackets and structural radiator supports. The appraiser should be aware of the overall condition of the vehicle and if the parts are cost effective when compared to new OEM. If the appraiser determines that the vehicle does not warrant the use of alternative parts, the appraiser should include comments to that effect. Based on the appraiser&rsquo;s inspection, the use of alternative parts is governed by the following. Note: January 1st will be considered the start of the model year for the purpose of determining the use of alternative parts. LIKE KIND &amp; QUALITY PARTS LKQ parts are recycled or used parts from another vehicle. These types of parts should be considered in all but the current model year vehicles. An LKQ part can be used on the current model year vehicle if it provides a benefit to the owner other than a cost savings. Non-mechanical LKQ parts are defined as parts taken off a vehicle of the same model year or newer. Mechanical LKQ are defined as parts that have the same or lower mileage and the same model year or newer. LKQ parts should not be considered on safety items or when the operational safety of the vehicle might be impaired. Examples of items that should not be used as LKQ parts are: &bull; Air Bag Systems or Passive Restraint Components &bull; Brake Systems &bull; Tires &bull; Aluminum Cradles &bull; Aluminum &amp; Alloy Wheels &bull; Moveable, Wearing Suspension Parts When appropriate LKQ sources such as APU, Comsearch, LKQ Corp., RPS or Internet searches must be utilized to locate LKQ parts. If the appraiser does not feel a search for LKQ parts is warranted or chooses not to use them when available an explanation must be documented. RECONDITIONED, REMANUFACTURED OR REBUILT PARTS Reconditioned, remanufactured and rebuilt parts are used OEM parts that have been rebuilt or refurbished. These types of parts should be considered on all vehicles except current model year. AFTERMARKET PARTS (A/M) Aftermarket Parts are new replacement parts manufactured by a company other than the original automaker. A/M crash parts excluding bumpers, bumper covers and lamps should not be considered during the first three model years. For example, after January 1, 2011 A/M sheet metal parts should be considered on 2008 model vehicles. A/M bumpers, lamps, radiators, A/C condensers and mechanical parts should be considered on all vehicles except the current model year. If an OEM warranty exists on the part being replaced and the warranty by the A/M part supplier is not equivalent, The Hanover will assume the terms and conditions of that warranty. ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURED PARTS (OEM) OEM parts are parts manufactured by or for the Automaker in the production of new vehicles and sold as replacement parts. OEM parts should be considered when all previous options are inappropriate due to a lack of availability, quality, cost effectiveness, age or condition of the vehicle. GLASS REPLACEMENT Contact our glass vendor to obtain The Hanover/Citizens price quote for glass replacement. LKQ or OEM glass should be compared and considered when warranted. FRAME &amp; UNIBODY STRUCTURAL REPAIRS Sectioning All sectioning should be performed to OEM and I-CAR standards. Partial Sectioning This Procedure should be considered if complete panel replacement would include disassembly in undamaged areas which would affect a large number of factory welds and corrosion protections. The use of a LKQ section is appropriate when damage involves panels joined together to form assemblies such as pillars, quarters, inner and outer rockers, etc. Body Sectioning Rear full-body sectioning may be the most practical form of reworking the passenger compartment. It can produce a vehicle as strong and serviceable as one that was never damaged by maintaining factory welds, sealants, and structural integrity. This section can be installed with or without the roof panel. This type of repair should be fully disclosed and agreed to by the vehicle owner. Note: Front full-body sectioning including cowl, dash and hinge pillars is not recommended. &nbsp;DEPRECIATION / BETTERMENT (Excluding NJ, NY &amp; TX) Depreciation/Betterment should be applied as described below unless conditions warrant otherwise. Applicable betterment/depreciation should not exceed 80% on any applicable part. Replacement options other than OEM may warrant consideration in the reduction or elimination of depreciation/betterment. No depreciation should be taken while an item is covered under an Original Equipment Manufactures warranty at the time of the loss. Tires Tread depth of all available damaged tires should be measured and documented in the appraisers claim summary. Based on the remaining tread depth, Depreciation /Betterment should be applied when appropriate. In the event that the tires are not available to be measured, depreciation should be applied based on the mileage on the tires at the time of loss. Batteries Depreciation/Betterment should be pro-rated on batteries based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended life expectancy. Manufacturer lifetime guaranteed batteries should be replaced without applying any depreciation or betterment. Engines / Transmissions Unless condition warrants otherwise, consideration of mileage and manufacturer&rsquo;s warranties should be taken into account prior to applying any depreciation/betterment on a new engine/transmission assembly. Exhaust Betterment should be based on condition of the system. Paint Betterment should be based on the overall condition of the vehicle&rsquo;s paint. Generally Betterment should not be taken on partial refinishing without documentation. Vinyl / Convertible Tops Betterment should be based on the condition of the vehicle&rsquo;s top. Audio &amp; Video Equipment Depreciation/Betterment should be pro-rated based on the average life expectancy. Vehicles with Premium Price Aftermarket electronic equipment require that coverage be verified. Mechanical Parts &amp; Components, Interior Trim &amp; Sheet Metal Parts Betterment should be based on the condition of the parts being replaced. TOWING &amp; STORAGE If the loss vehicle is at the repair facility the appraiser should view the tow bill, include the charges in the appraisal and include a digital image of the bill. If the loss vehicle is not at the repair facility and will likely incuradditional charges this should be documented and the charges should not be included in the appraisal. Negotiations When a vehicle is inspected at the repair facility of the owner&rsquo;s choice, the appraiser should review the completed appraisal with the shop owner or manager to obtain an agreement on the damages. If the repair facility has any questions or areas of disagreement, discuss these with them to a conclusion. Once they agree with your appraisal leave them a copy. If the vehicle is not inspected at a repair facility, the appraiser should contact the repair facility of the owner&rsquo;s choice by phone, tell them what you have written and email/fax them a copy of your appraisal for his/her consideration. Document on the appraisal to whom at the shop you spoke. If an owner does not have a repair facility preference and asks you where he/she can get the vehicle repaired, refer them to their handling adjuster listed on the assignment sheet. Always remind the owner that they have the right to choose any repair facility. It is the job of the appraiser to use his/her skill, judgment and discretion in determining how much it will cost to repair the damages. Appraisers have broad discretion to negotiate with shops and to come to an agreement on the cost to repair the damages. With respect to labor rates, the company will provide guidance as to what it believes to be the prevailing labor rate in particular geographic areas. If an appraiser believes that this guidance does not accurately reflect what the appraiser believes to be the prevailing labor rate in a given area, or that a special circumstance exists which warrant a deviation from the prevailing rate in a particular instance, they should discuss this with the company. If the appraiser is unable to reach an agreement with the shop, the appraiser must alert the adjuster handling the claim. We will not pay more than the retail price for any Sublet Item, Part or Labor amount to restore a vehicle to its previous condition. Supplements The appraiser will determine if a second inspection is required after considering logistics, consistency of damages, and dollar amount. If a second inspection is required it should be completed within 24 hours of initial request. If it is determined that a physical inspection is not required, the appraiser should request invoices of any replacement parts and complete the supplement within 24 hours of receiving all necessary documents. When a physical inspection is not made it should be noted in the claim summary. TOTAL LOSS HANDLING Determining The handling of all total loss vehicles must be in accordance with state regulations. On all total losses unrelated damage must be itemized, priced and supported with photographs. In determining whether a car is a total loss, it is necessary to determine the following factors as accurately as possible:&bull; Cost of Repair&bull; Potential Supplement Amounts&bull; Salvage Value All&nbsp; total losses will be called into&nbsp; CCC. Use a CCC form CONTACT OWNER advise of potential total, go over vehicle options and mileage.&nbsp; Note your summary that this task was completed. &nbsp; CCC CODES &nbsp; OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17995&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; WA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17996&nbsp; CONTACT THE&nbsp;ADJUSTER AT HANOVER&nbsp;AND ADVISE OF TOTAL LOSS Complete a Total loss Hotline template and a theft sheet.

Photographs/Invoices: Appraisers must photograph all damaged areas including prior damage as outlined in the photo guidelines document. There is no limit on the number of photographs,&nbsp;take as many as needed to document the claim properly. Several angles and views of the point of impact are required. These photographs are invaluable in assisting&nbsp;the file handler in making liability decisions and when subrogation or arbitration is necessary. &bull;Towing (Do Not add to Estimate), storage and sublet invoices are required documents for the claim file. Parts invoices are required to document parts price differences. &bull; Supporting documents such as tow bills and parts invoices should attached as a PDF. Uploading documents as a photograph is discouraged. &bull; Remember to take a photo of the posted labor rate board and storage fees Open/Hidden Damage: &bull; The appraiser should write the appraisal to cover all repairs, operations and materials necessary to return the vehicle to pre-loss condition. However, hidden damage&nbsp;should not be included in the appraisal until it can be confirmed with photographic evidence. &bull; The appraiser should document the possibility of open/hidden damage. &bull; The appraiser should actively seek a disassembly to accurately determine the extent of damages when deemed necessary.&nbsp; Max of 2.0 hrs Parts Replacement Options: &bull; The following is the order for parts searches for all Amica Claims 1. OE Surplus Parts: OEM Parts that are distributed by a 3rd Party 2. Recycled (Used Parts): You must consider LKQ Parts on all vehicles older than current year and/or those with mileage in excess 15,000 miles if cost effective. Amica &nbsp; &nbsp;does not subscribe to the use of LKQ steering/suspension, brake components, restraint parts and tires. Front/Rear beam type, differential axles and subframe/cradle&nbsp;may be considered for replacement with an LKQ assy, if applicable. If LKQ/Recycled parts are used, the appraisal must contain the recycle vendor, phone number and&nbsp;reference number. 3. Reconditioned Parts: May be used on vehicles older than the current model year or if the vehicle has more than 15,000 miles. These include bumper covers, steering&nbsp;rack/pinion assemblies, and CV axle assemblies and headlamps. 4. Aftermarket Parts (non crash parts): These parts consist of items such as radiators, AC condensers, engines, steering racks, wheels, glass, minor lamps and other&nbsp;mechanical parts. These may be considered on vehicles older than the current model year or if the vehicle has more than 15,000 miles. 5. Aftermarket Parts (Crash Parts): These parts are sheet metal components, bumper covers, grilles, header panels, bumper reinforcements, and head lamps. Amica does NOT subscribe to the practice of using these parts,&nbsp;however, if a situation warrants these parts, the appraiser should obtain permission from the owner and document accordingly. The use of aftermarket crash parts requires the approval from an APD Supervisor prior&nbsp;to inclusion on the appraisal. Unibody/Frame Pull time: &bull; Maximum allowance for set up and measure is 2.0 hours. &bull; All set up and measure is to be list at Body Rate. Clipping (Full Body Sectioning): &bull; Amica does not subscribe to the practice of Clipping. &bull; All section type repairs must adhere to vehicle maker or I-CAR guidelines. If no guidelines exist, the section replacement should not be considered a viable repair&nbsp;method. Supplement: &bull; All supplements must be re-inspected, damaged parts photographed, and invoices obtained and uploaded into the CCC claim file. &bull; Parts price differences do not need to be inspected, however, invoices must be obtained and uploaded into the CCC claim file as a PDF. Total Losses: &bull; Amica will not accept or standby any &ldquo;Contract or No Supplement Repair&rdquo;, either the vehicle is repairable or it is a total loss. &bull; The appraiser may use NADA Clean Retail as a first reference in determining a total loss vehicle. &bull; Unless state regulation dictates otherwise, the total loss threshold guideline is 75% of NADA Clean Retail. It is also acceptable to use the repair amount + salvage value method to suggest a total loss settlement. &bull; CCC users must run the valuation thru CCC1. Non CCC users must complete &amp; upload a CCC form. Do NOT call them in! &bull; The appraisers must obtain an accurate salvage value using CoPart&rsquo;s Pro Quote. You can access this via Copart&rsquo;s website or by calling Copart directly. &middot; The appraiser will open their web browser (Microsoft Explorer) and enter the following web address: https://seller.copart.com &middot; Once the CoPart Home is displayed the appraiser must click on Seller Access &middot; When the seller log in page is displayed the appraiser will enter the following Unique Identification (the very first time they long in only): User ID: AMIGENERIC Password: AMIGENERIC &bull; It is appraiser&rsquo;s responsibility to contact the owner and obtain permission to move the vehicle to Copart. If the appraiser is unable to move the vehicle he/she should&nbsp;note the summary report of the salvage vehicle&rsquo;s status. &bull; If the owner releases the vehicle, contact our National Salvage Vendor &ndash; CoPart at the following number 800-269-4885 &ndash; Select #1 and arrange for a salvage pick up &bull; CCC Valuescope will, in most cases, report an instant value; this is the ACV of the vehicle. The ACV, Salvage Value, CCC Valuescope Request number, storage rate,&nbsp;CoPart Lot Number and current charges against the vehicle must be provided in your summary report. Large Loss: &bull; The appraiser should identify potential large loss situations as early in the process as possible. This usually pertains to newer, high value vehicles. &bull; The first estimate may be delayed pending disassembly to avoid a large supplement and/or total loss situation. &bull; The appraiser should be proactive in communicating to the shop the need for disassembly and work with the shop to determine a re-inspection date and time,&nbsp;preferably within 48 hours of the initial inspection. &bull; The appraiser should provide to the shop clear instructions as to the extent of disassembly so as not to diminish the salvage value if a total loss settlement is&nbsp;possible. Only allow the minimum disassembly required for the damage discovery process. &bull; Do not wait/allow the shop to perform a complete disassembly of the vehicle and order parts prior to contacting you for a supplement. &bull; Document the reason for the delayed first estimate and communicate the process to the customer and the claim rep. &bull; Take into consideration the entirety of the claim payment. Rental, potential supplement and loss of value affect the final settlement. Try to see the end of the claim&nbsp;upfront and advise of the best possible settlement for the situation. This may result in your advising of a total loss settlement when the repair amount is less than&nbsp;75%. Communicate with the claim rep and work together to arrive at the best possible settlement for the customer.

Principles that Guide our Claims Employees Be professional Be empathetic Be proactive in keeping customers informed Be clear in setting expectations and follow through on promises Be consistent in writing accurate appraisals Our customers rely on us to help them successfully navigate the claims process.&nbsp; A knowledgeable, responsive, and empathetic claims employee is critical to the delivery of great customer service. Studies have shown that compromising claims accuracy and overpaying claims does not improve customer service. Paying the correct amount to settle a total loss or return a repairable vehicle to pre-accident condition coupled with the principles noted above are what customers expect. Estimating: All auto damage estimates are prepared using the CCC System. The Appraiser is expected to complete and upload the appraisal at the time of the inspection. A copy of the completed appraisal report should be given to the vehicle owner or left with the repair shop.&nbsp; If the Appraiser is completing an extended search for used parts, the appraisal should be uploaded no later than the day of inspection.&nbsp; If an Appraiser is unable to complete the estimate at the time of inspection, the adjuster must be notified. Any information needed to clarify repair decisions should be included in the estimate. If there are any questions as to whether specific damage is related to the claimed loss, the appraiser should review the claim file and if necessary contact the Claims Rep to clarify the claimed damages. The Appraiser should inform the shop that the appraisal is not an authorization to repair and does not guarantee payment. Only the vehicle owner can provide repair authorization. The Appraiser will conduct a preliminary inspection of the entire vehicle. During this inspection it is expected the appraiser will:&nbsp; Identify the vehicle using the vehicle ID number, license plate, year, mileage, make and model Complete all necessary Administrative Data fields Evaluate its general condition, write items that you can see are damaged Analyze points of impact Identify and document prior damage&nbsp; Document all vehicle options Determine the best sequence of appraising the damage Do not assume that other hidden items have been damaged. Estimates are to be completed and left at the scene of the inspection. (Document why if otherwise) The estimate and/or report must reflect the complete name and address of the shop where the car is located. Estimates should have the proper heading complete, name of the inspection location, location of damage, mileage, days to repair, and any other pertinent information. Consider the reparability of the individual parts&nbsp; Remember section panels (for example, quarter, floor and rocker panels) when appropriate for the repair Diagnostics and Scanning: Scanning vehicles and calibration of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has been a much-discussed topic throughout the collision repair industry. But what are the differences between the two, and what does it mean for collision repairs? Scanning &ldquo;Often referred to as Pre-Repair Scan/Pre-Scan/Health Scan (Capturing Codes) is a step in the damage analysis/blueprinting process used to identify errors, faults, and/or damage related, and unrelated, to the collision. While a Post-Repair Scan/Post-Scan (Identifying/Clearing Codes) is a quality control process used to ensure all vehicle system diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs), related and unrelated to the collision, and those set during the repair, have been identified and cleared.&rdquo; Calibration &ldquo;A Post-Repair Calibration/Initialization (PRC/I) often referred to as aiming, module setup, relearn, zero-point calibration, initiation, or calibration is a required step following the removal, installation, and/or repair of many safety and driver convenience system parts.&rdquo; The collision repair industry often interchanges these two terms and that will lead to confusion. For example, if you send a vehicle out to the local dealer for a calibration and say, &ldquo;It just needs a scan.&rdquo; The dealer will most likely plug in the scan tool and clear codes, then return the vehicle as complete. In most cases, the sensors/modules do not know they were replaced or that any calibration is required. To prevent this confusion, start with the OEM Calibration Requirements Search to identify the ADAS parts that will require calibration when repair operations occur that affect ADAS parts. Next, you will need to provide a detailed list of all the processes that need to be completed; better still if the list includes the actual OEM procedure the vehicle needs. This will eliminate a lot of confusion around what needs to be done while improving cycle time for all involved. I-Car Repairability Technical Support Matrix with OEM Calibration Requirements (I-Car logon credentials are required to view matrix information) This I-Car matrix does not currently contain all production vehicles sold in the United States. Please refer back to this page frequently to ensure the most up-to-date information. The contents are based on the repair information available from the vehicle maker. Updates and additions will be posted as they become available. To ensure that the most recent information is used, always refer to the vehicle maker's technical information. Alternative&nbsp;Resource&nbsp; OEM 1 Stop as presented by the OEM Collision Repair Roundtable, Inc. and the National Automotive Service Task Force Appearance Allowance: Appearance allowance&rsquo; is a term used when there is minor cosmetic damage to a part of the vehicle. It is not offered for damage that affects the safe operation of the vehicle. It is a negotiated settlement with the property owner enabling us to give the customer an allowance in lieu of repairs that subject the customer to a large out of pocket depreciation expense or a cosmetic repair that does not affect the operation of the vehicle. The Appraiser decides when appearance allowances are granted and exercises discretion based upon condition and use. &nbsp; Examples: Nicks, Dents, Scratches to bumpers, moldings, or wheel covers, Minor tears to interior trim or upholstery. Betterment and Depreciation: Betterment generally applies when it is determined, through the inspection process, that we will be putting the customer&rsquo;s vehicle in a better condition than it was prior to the date of loss. Depreciation is used to adjust the amount of the settlement to match the life expectancy of the part that will be replaced. Depreciation applies to items that wear out and won't last the life of the vehicle. Example: a battery that requires replacing after a loss, with a five-year life may be depreciated 40% if being replaced after two years. It is taken if the part being replaced is a new OEM or rebuilt OEM part. Any kind of Betterment/depreciation for the customer should be documented as itemized and specific deductions on the estimate/valuation. The explanation/justification of the adjustment is to be documented consistent with estimating state guidelines. It is necessary that we recognize that depreciation/betterment is explained at the appropriate level in-order that all parties understand why it applies. Betterment/depreciation should generally be taken on the part only, not the labor to remove or reinstall the part on the vehicle. Betterment/depreciation would not exceed 70%. Betterment/depreciation should be considered on the parts that generally do not last the lifetime of the car: tires, batteries, convertible tops, upholstery, and other similar items. Betterment/depreciation must be based on age, mileage, visible wear, and applies when new replacement parts are figured. Tire shaving by a qualified professional may be an alternative to betterment on a tire and could be appropriate on vehicle with All-wheel drive and specific tire tread tolerances.&nbsp; Examine the owner&rsquo;s manual or manufacturer's requirements regarding tire tolerance. Betterment would not apply if the replacement part is an aftermarket, Opt-OEM, recycled or reconditioned part, and the damaged part was OEM. An appearance allowance, rather than replacement, may be considered for minor cosmetic damage to such items as bumpers, trim, and wheels. Acceptance of an appearance allowance is voluntary for the customer. Please be certain to clearly explain their options. Follow all state guidelines (Ex: NY). Betterment may also exist in situations where a part sustains accident-related damage and requires repair or replacement. However, the part had significant pre-existing wear, tear, or damage. Documentation: All customer interactions whether in person or over the phone including contacts with body shops, rental companies and other vendors should be documented in the claims system of record. &nbsp; A brief summary of each interaction should be documented specifically focusing on questions and answers, pending issues or concerns, and expectations that were set. &nbsp; Detailed documentation must be contained in each electronic claim file to permit the reconstruction of the activities and decision making relative to the claim. Documentation consists of letters, emails, photos, estimates, claim system fields, claim notes, etc.&nbsp; Such documentation can provide evidence to show that the claim was handled properly including timely communication.&nbsp; &nbsp; A claim file should show a clear history and development of the claim. It should read like a story with a clear beginning and, once all exposures are properly resolved, a clear ending.&nbsp; Flood Guidelines: Partial Submersion Definition (Fresh Water) Water Level:&nbsp; An important factor in the handling of flood losses is the level reached by the water during the flood.&nbsp; In general, a partial submersion occurs when water rises to a level not higher than the lower portion of the instrument panel. Items usually serviced during this type of loss include upholstery, electrical components, and differential/engine/ transmission components. Waterline marks should be measured and photographed when visible. Do not assume any areas may be free of damage. Check for water levels under the hood, in the passenger compartment, and in the trunk area. Never start the engine on a flood vehicle until the fluids have been checked and possibly changed. Check for water in quarter extensions, spare tire well, air cleaner, fuse box, under floor mats, door storage pockets and center console storage. Vehicles that have been closed and locked are subject to excessive condensation. This condensation can cause damage to parts that were not initially submerged, including electrical items and upholstery. When evaluating damages to partially submerged vehicles follow the &lsquo;Flood Water Damage Estimating Guidelines&rsquo;. Total Submersion Definition (Fresh Water) This occurs when the water level rises above the lower portion of the instrument panel. Repairing a totally submerged vehicle is not practical &ndash; these should be handled as total losses. Salt Water and Waste Water Flooding Water Level:&nbsp; If the water line is At/Below the rocker panel with no intrusion into the passenger compartment:&nbsp; Follow the &lsquo;Flood Water Damage Estimating Guidelines&rsquo;. If the water line is At/Above the rocker panel with intrusion into the passenger compartment:&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the corrosive nature of saltwater, and contamination associated with wastewater, it is generally not practical to repair a vehicle involved in these kinds of flooding. Total Loss/Total Submersion - Flood Water Damage Estimating Guidelines These guidelines apply when assessing the total loss of flood losses (i.e. full submersion (freshwater), salt/wastewater with water At/Above the rocker panel with intrusion into the passenger compartment: Photo documentation of water line in addition to Photo Guidelines Run ACV for vehicle following Total Loss Valuation Guidelines In CCC estimate create a one-line estimate. In the Description field type &ldquo;Vehicle is a Total Loss due to Flood Damage&rdquo; In the Price field enter the ACV dollar amount (Example: ACV = $8,056.00, enter $8056.00 No Tax) In the Vehicle Tab, Damage Section, select the Primary Damage field as 15.

Salt Water In the point of impact and Settlement Tab select, (15 POI) Total Loss Complete clam summary Lock and upload estimate to claim file Partial Loss - Flood Water Damage Estimating Guidelines These guidelines apply when assessing the reparability of flood losses (i.e. partial submersion (freshwater), salt/wastewater without intrusion into the passenger compartment, other as authorized by management).&nbsp; Determine whether the vehicle was running when it was submerged. If operating, did the engine &ldquo;hydro-lock&rdquo;** or make any unusual noise after going through the water? If not at a repair facility, contact the vehicle owner and move to shop of choice within the market. In order to determine the full extent of damage, it may be necessary to authorize certain preliminary repairs, cleanup, and/or diagnostics. Ensure the following items are agreed upon with the repairer prior to proceeding&hellip; Document all conversations with the shop and the vehicle owner. For items not found in the database, attempt to secure pricing from vendor or shop. Other items to consider cleaning and checking: Starter, alternator, master cylinder, behind wheels, rear axle water level (if relevant). &nbsp; It is desirable to steam clean the chassis if steam-cleaning facilities are available, otherwise flush with high-pressure clean water. Floor mats, door panels, carpeting or upholstery having water damage should be removed from the car, thoroughly flushed with clean water and air-dried. Jute padding should always be replaced when damaged by water. For cleaning purposes, it is not necessary to disassemble the engine, transmission, or differential of a partially submerged vehicle. The fluids in each of these systems should be checked. If any evidence of contamination exists, the fluid should be drained and replaced. The fluid should be checked again and the process repeated until the contaminant has been completely removed. Operation of a vehicle with contaminated fluids may damage internal systems due to improper lubrication. Damage to electrical components is common in flood losses.&nbsp; Electrical components should be removed and checked for water damage and replaced as needed. Hydro-lock This occurs when water enters the engine, usually through the air intake. The water enters the cylinders where the pistons attempt to compress it. Since you cannot compress a liquid, the engine seizes and considerable damage (cracked cylinder head or bent connecting rods) may be sustained to the engine. The key is whether the vehicle was running when the water got in the engine. If this occurs, the spark plugs should be taken out and the water removed from the engine. Change all fluids, steam clean and start the vehicle for a short period then drain all fluids again. After this, the vehicle should be started and checked for engine damage. Labor Rates: Sales Tax &ndash; Parts / Labor, Paint &amp; Materials Labor rate Excel sheet (excluding California) is attached in the forms section (can be searched by zip code), CA appraisers, please use area prevailing rates (note: audit may change rates to approved rates from Liberty). How to tax miscellaneous items on the appraisal may come into question from time to time, this is a high-level overview. You should follow state and local tax regulations Include applicable sales taxes for parts and/or labor in the appraisal.&nbsp; Please document sales tax has been confirmed for the local jurisdiction where the appraisal is taking place. Sublet Handling If sublet is utilized for repairs that are typically outside the scope of the standard auto body facility&rsquo;s operation, a sublet mark- up will be allowed. (Examples of 'out of scope' items include but are not limited to dealership sublets, upholstery repair, electrical repair, painted stripes, etc.). In such cases, sublet markup will be paid up to a maximum of 25% of the sublet bill, or DriveTime, but not to exceed $150 in either case. If sublet is utilized for repairs that are typically within the scope of a standard auto body facility&rsquo;s operation, Liberty Mutual will pay up to the estimating system book time for the repair. (Examples of &ldquo;within the scope&rdquo; items include but are not limited to Evacuate and Recharge, Suspension Work, Alignments, Glass R&amp;I, etc.) If the sublet part(s) being replaced are in the estimating system, they should be selected accordingly for accurate pricing and labor time/overlap.&nbsp; In the event, the part(s) are not in the database they should be listed individually with pricing and labor time. Sublet mark-up should be applied as stated above. Parts guideline: Examples of alternative parts that are currently available for use are: New Non-OEM Parts (Aftermarket) Non-New OEM parts (LKQ or RCY) DO NOT USE ON SAFETY ITEMS Optional&nbsp;OEM or&nbsp;Alternate OEM Reconditioned/remanufactured OEM parts&nbsp; Remember to always check the advisor report if you are unsure! New Non-OEM Parts (Aftermarket): When selecting&nbsp;New Non-OEM parts, Liberty claims professionals should specify parts that&nbsp;meet OEM quality.&nbsp; Liberty Mutual will also use qualified aftermarket parts in the repair of third party claimant vehicles, except for the states of Wyoming and Minnesota.&nbsp; Aftermarket crash parts and headlamps should be independently certified to match OEM quality.&nbsp; Please refer to the&nbsp;GRM U.S.&nbsp;Parts Matrix&nbsp;to determine which parts are appropriate for the repair of the vehicle and any state statute limitations.&nbsp; When applicable, New Non-OEM and remanufactured parts should be considered when replacing steering/suspension and mechanical parts, utilize local and national dealers such as, but not limited to: NAPA, AutoZone, O&rsquo;Reilly, Pep Boys, Advanced Auto Parts and Keystone.&nbsp;Specify OEM equivalent or better. New Non-OEM certification is not required on items such as splash shields and liners. Non-New OEM Parts (RCY): Non-New-Recycled OEM (RCY)&nbsp;Non-moveable parts&nbsp;same model year or newer, Mechanical Parts same model year or newer, same mileage or less - reference the parts matrix for the appropriate application. LKQ (RCY) Parts Grading &ndash; Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; parts should only be utilized.&nbsp; In some instances, a grade &ldquo;B&rdquo; part may be appropriate if an assembly is being purchased to utilize the undamaged parts, or in rare cases when an older vehicle is being repaired and the &ldquo;B&rdquo; grade part is the only one available. The file needs to be noted accordingly by the appraiser regarding the reason for grade &ldquo;B&rdquo; usage. Non-New OEM parts markup is generally 20 to 25%.&nbsp; OPT OE: Discounted OPT OEM (Optional OEM) or ALT OEM (Alternative OEM) parts are OEM parts that may be provided by or through alternate sources other than the OEM vehicle dealerships. OPT OEM or ALT OEM parts may reflect some specific, special, or unique pricing or discount. OPT OEM or ALT OEM parts may include ""Blemished"" parts provided by OEM's through OEM vehicle dealerships. OEM Surplus: Parts that the OEM manufacturer may have rejected for reasons of a flaw in material or workmanship or a surplus of parts. OEM Surplus part pricing is typically &gt;10% lower than New OE. *Please note: A new OEM part with a discount applied does not classify as an OE Surplus part.&nbsp; General Alternative Parts Guidelines: Unless noted in the Parts Matrix guidelines and supplier list, alternative parts usage should be considered as long as they're compliance with applicable state statutes, regulations and Department of Insurance bulletins. Applicable state specific parts reference information is also included in the Parts Matrix along with repair guidelines. Please review the attached flow chart for the parts sourcing protocol Parts Sourcing Workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare the cost of New OEM versus Non-New OEM parts (when appropriate). Non-New OEM parts may not always be cost effective once markup, shipping, additional rental cost and trim time are applied. Decisions to repair or replace a part should include any possible added refinish expense resulting from blends, edging or interior refinish needed. &nbsp;""Non-New OEM""&nbsp;Part Certifications: CAPA : Certified Automotive Parts Association (CAPA) is a non-profit organization established in 1987 to develop and oversee a test program guaranteeing the suitability and quality of automotive parts. NSF : National Sanitation Fund is an International, accredited, independent third-party certification body that tests and certifies products to verify they meet these public health and safety standards. Diamond Standard : Certified on all measures of quality by NSF and CAPA. The is denoted by suffix DSC or DSN i.e. 01234567DSN or 01234567DSC. The Diamond Standard discipline of Certification began in 2002 with a robust, unique program of quasi-static, dynamic and destructive testing and Certification across all categories comparatively to OE service parts. The testing protocols were designed by Crashworthiness experts from NHTSA and MGA with tests conducted in industry leading, credible and accredited facilities used by all OE manufacturers. One of the primary roles included in this testing result is the certification by MGA, NSF and CAPA that Diamond Standard Brand parts are equivalent in performance to the OE service parts they replace Liberty Mutual and Safeco OEM Endorsement Information:&nbsp; AMC (LM and SA) Vehicle Qualifies For Aftermarket Crash Parts: In addition to the standard Liberty Mutual parts policy, certified aftermarket crash parts may be used in the repair including: CAPA, NSF and Diamond Standard. This excludes any structural or safety related parts. Always refer to and follow any state and local specific law or regulation when sourcing parts. OEMC (LM Only) Vehicle Does Not Qualify For Aftermarket Crash Parts: The standard Liberty Mutual policy applies (Please refer to the Parts Matrix for your particular state.) Typically, the policy allows for OEM crash parts including rebuilt, remanufactured, reconditioned, optional OEM, and recycled OEM parts. Aftermarket fender liners, mirrors and many OEM equivalent mechanical parts are also allowed. NOEM (LM and SA) Vehicle Qualifies for New OEM Only: The written estimate will include the cost of new original vehicle manufacturer parts as replacement parts. This does not apply to the repair or replacement of vehicle safety glass. If a new original vehicle manufacturer part is not in production or distribution, the estimate may include a new non-original vehicle manufacturer part or a reconditioned original vehicle manufactured part. (This endorsement is Not Applicable in some states as indicated in the Parts Matrix) AF (LM Only) Affinity Parts Guidelines Apply: Please follow guidelines for the affinity program. All OEM parts would qualify, including rebuild, remanufactured, reconditioned, Optional OEM, and recycled OEM parts. OEM Parts Usage is excluded in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Always refer to and follow any state and local specific law or regulation when sourcing parts. Advanced Safety Systems: Advanced driver assistance systems , or ADAS, are systems to help the driver in the driving process. Key active safety systems include: Automatic emergency braking (AEB):&nbsp;Brakes are automatically applied to prevent a collision or reduce collision speed. Forward-collision warning (FCW):&nbsp;Visual and/or audible warning intended alert the driver and prevent a collision. Blind-spot warning (BSW):&nbsp;Visual and/or audible notification of vehicle in blind spot. The system may provide an additional warning if you use your turn signal when there is a car next to you in another lane. Rear cross-traffic warning:&nbsp;Visual, audible, or haptic notification of object or vehicle out of rear camera range, but could be moving into it. Rear automatic emergency braking (Rear AEB):&nbsp;Brakes are automatically applied to prevent backing into something behind the vehicle. This could be triggered by the rear cross-traffic system, or other sensors on the vehicle. Lane-departure warning (LDW):&nbsp;Visual, audible, or haptic warning to alert the driver when they are crossing lane markings. Lane-keeping assist (LKA):&nbsp;Automatic corrective steering input or braking provided by the vehicle when crossing lane markings. Lane-centering assist: &nbsp;Continuous active steering to stay in between lanes (active steer, auto-steer, etc.) Adaptive cruise control: &nbsp;Adaptive cruise uses lasers, radar, cameras, or a combination of these systems to keep a constant distance between you and the car ahead, automatically maintaining a safe following distance.&nbsp; If highway traffic slows, some systems will bring the car to a complete stop and automatically come back to speed when traffic gets going again, allowing the driver to do little more than pay attention and steer. Photo Documentation Guidelines All Appraisers are required to photograph the damage to the vehicle and upload them to the correct claim file, and all photographs will be taken utilizing a digital camera. The quality and the number of photos must be sufficient to properly document the claimed damages, vehicle condition and options. Each photo should be reviewed by the Appraiser prior to upload as high quality photographs are critical to the fair assessment of claims. Poor quality images must be corrected or deleted prior to upload. Do not upload multiple pictures of the same view and angle. c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have enough distance to allow identification of the damaged part. With the different cameras being used the resolution settings will differ. Our claim system will only accept .jpg images up to 3MB in size so ensure the resolution settings and image type are correctly set. Do NOT display a time or date stamp on the images. Overall view of the vehicle, typical four (4) corner images One (1) or more close up shots showing all damaged areas One (1) photo of odometer reading. o&nbsp;&nbsp; If unable to obtain odometer look for other evidence of approximate mileage (i.e., oil change stickers, maintenance records, etc.). One (1) clear photo of VIN for vehicle identification o&nbsp;&nbsp; Windshield VIN preferred if visible, otherwise use primary door VIN decal. &nbsp; Additional photos may be required to document: All old damage (related or unrelated)&nbsp; Additional damage found on supplement inspection. Steering column and ignition switch on partial and total thefts. Tow and Storage Bill Air bag deployment or damage to any other restraint system (seat belts). Any necessary to support the Appraiser&rsquo;s conclusion, especially if it appears disputable.

13178,"American Family Insurance Company","6000 American Parkway",Madison,WI,53783,800-692-6326,AUTODISPATCH@afics.com,,"Introduction This guide provides you with the general procedures and guidelines for handling claim assignments. These guidelines and procedures will help you provide the best possible service to our mutual customers. State laws and regulations supersede these guidelines and are to be observed in all cases. Exceptional circumstances may exist in which a guideline does not apply. In these situations, you will need to work with your assigned representative. All vendors shall make all possible efforts to maintain the confidentiality of any personally identifiable customer or employee information that may be received pursuant to the conduct of business. Personally, identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, birthdays, financial information, and vehicle repair records. Additionally, the contents of these guidelines are not to be disclosed to a third party. Potential Conflicts of Interest You must avoid even the appearance of impropriety. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, assignments for your employee-owned vehicles and vehicles owned by relatives of your employees, management, or owners should be referred back for reassignment to a neutral third party. This list does not include all conflict situations. You are expected to contact your representative when these or any potential conflict or sensitive situations exist. Keys to Customer Service We are committed to providing superior service to our customers. We measure customer service based on the following areas, and we ask you to provide exceptional service in these areas as well: Courtesy and friendliness Customer Contact Specific Timeline Instructions &ndash; 24 hrs. from time of assignment Prompt inspection and completion of the assignment Promptness of returning calls and keeping the customer well informed from time of assignment through completion of the inspection Ability to answer questions Ability to explain the inspection process Offer options for receiving updates Update portal or adjuster via email or phone every 3 days after assignment made until Packet uploaded Service Level Expectations See IA Service Level Expectations attachment for General Expectations Notes &amp; File Documentation All notes are to be entered into the Notes tab in CCC ONE. Notes and documentation must be specific, factual, and appropriate. Please avoid subjective commentary when adding documentation to the file. Examples include: Initial Contact Documentation: Contact Date and Time: Name of contact/phone number: Inspection scheduled - Date, Time &amp; location: Appraiser full name and contact information (phone &amp; e-mail): Inspection Documentation: Gross Estimate total ($000.00) Repair or Total Loss: Photos taken as required: Number of repair days: Were additional part searches required? If yes, list supplier and name/quote # Any additional notes: Additional Total Loss Documentation: Estimated Salvage Value: Verify Sales Tax Rate: Verify other applicable fees such as but not limited to license fees, transfer fees, etc. Supplement Documentation: Gross Supplement total ($000.00) Please issue payment to: Shop info including TIN # Supporting documentation including photos &amp; invoices attached (Y/N): Any additional notes: The following claim information is required to appear on every estimate. Claim number Date of loss Damage assessed by Inspection type (Independent Field) Type of loss (comprehensive, collision, liability) Deductible Inspection date Number of days for repair (4 total labor hours = 1 day of repair) Owner&rsquo;s name and address Owner&rsquo;s phone numbers VIN Year, make and model Mileage Options Point(s) of impact Loss designation &ndash; properly coded &ldquo;repairable&rdquo; or &ldquo;total loss&rdquo;. Note: When a vehicle originally thought to be repairable is later determined to be a total loss, you must go back and change the loss designation to a total loss. A CCC Basic Claim Information Form must be completed when the loss vehicle is flagged as a total loss or appears to be a borderline total loss. See total loss section Labor Rates The local going labor rate for each inspection territory will be reflected on the estimate of record. Photo Guidelines Photo documentation must include a minimum of: Repairable: 10 photos showing Each corner of the loss vehicle &ndash; 4 photos Vehicle identification number (VIN ) &ndash; 1 photo Odometer (if not accessible, per oil change sticker or service document) &ndash; 1 photo License plate &ndash; 1 photo Area of damage &ndash; number of photos necessary to clearly represent the damage, support repair times and justify repair/replace decisions &ndash; 2 photos minimum, taken at different angles Prior damage (if present) Total Loss: Refer to Total Loss bullet point number two Repair Approach Determine appropriate approach in the following order of priority: Repair damaged parts if cost-effective when compared to replacing the part. Factor required blending and R&amp;I into this determination. Where replacement is warranted, replace with alternative parts when applicable based on replacement parts usage guidelines beginning on the bottom of on page eight (8). Replace with an OEM parts. Glass Lesser of Salvage / Sublet / NAGS / OEM with the following restrictions: Recycled windshields should not be used. All other recycled glass is acceptable. Safelite is the vendor of choice. Call 877-664-8931 or go to safelite.com to obtain a quote. Any glass-related recalibrations should be addressed per manufacturer guidelines. Unrelated Prior Damage When unrelated prior damage is observed it must be noted in CCC ONE under the Vehicle Tab as a Prior Damage Note. If the customer is claiming the damage is related to the loss the following steps must be taken: If the customer insists the damage is related explain that it will not be added to the estimate at this time and the information will be communicated to the insurance company to review further. Call the file handler to notify them of the situation. Upload all documentation as soon as possible so it is available for review. Written documentation must be professional and factual as it will become part of our claim file. Markups and Discounts All markups and discounts, including: parts discounts, sublet, recycled and remanufactured parts must be entered as a &ldquo;Line Markup&rdquo; in the estimate. Markup must not be included in the part price. Sublet charges should not exceed retail price after mark up. Refinish Paint and Materials Threshold The threshold for negotiations of paint and materials is $500 (excluding California) and should be considered a point at which to consider negotiations. Negotiations of paint and materials should be handled on a claim by claim basis and must be well documented in the claim file. Blending Blending may be applicable when a color match from one panel to another needs to be facilitated and it is determined to be the most appropriate and cost-effective method to accomplish this. Examples of situations where blending may not be necessary: When adjacent panels do not exist on the same sight plane: Due to various effects caused by additives, such as metallic, pearls, tinted clears, etc., the color may change depending on your viewing angle and lighting. Note that in some instances, such as the current generation Camaro&rsquo;s door to quarter panel, the panels on the same side of the vehicle may not be on the same sight plane. When the existing paint color is a non-metallic color. These colors are typically easily matched, have a low number of color variances, and are not as sensitive to spray techniques or temperature at the time of application Interior panels (i.e. jambs, under the hood, floors, rear body panels, core supports, etc.) When the adjacent panels are different substrates Example: quarter panel to plastic bumper cover When there is a pre-existing color match issue on the potential blend panel(s) When prior damage or conditions (i.e. rock chips, rust, peeling paint, etc.) exist on the potential blend panel(s) Refinish Within Panel Boundaries Depending on the size of the damage and the panel, it is often possible to blend the color within the same panel. Since the color blend is achieved and contained within the panel, this process negates the need to blend into the adjacent undamaged panels. This operation should be considered and negotiated for whenever applicable. Refinish within Panel Boundaries guidelines: Can and should be applied if applicable regardless of the number of panels being refinished. The operation should not be considered based on a formula or be qualified by a percentage of the panel being refinished. Any adjustment made to refinish labor must not exceed the system-generated full panel refinish and will generally not result in a labor allowance below the system-generated blend labor. All damage entries where Refinish within Panel Boundaries is applied must have the corresponding remark, &ldquo;Refinish within Panel Boundaries, includes full clear&rdquo;. Partial Refinish The term Partial Refinish is used to describe a repaired panel that does not require the complete surface to be refinished. The most common examples would be where a clear break is present on a two-tone box side in which only one color needs to be applied. Clearcoat of the entire panel may or may not be required. Partial Refinish Guidelines: Can and should be applied if applicable regardless of the number of panels being refinished. The operation should not be considered based on a formula or a percentage of the panel being refinished. Any adjustment made to refinish labor must not exceed the system-generated full panel refinishes and will generally not result in a labor allowance below the system-generated blend labor. All damage entries where Partial Refinish is applied must have the corresponding remark, &ldquo;Partial Refinish&rdquo;. Corrosion Protection Corrosion protection should not be added to the repair estimate when replacing a bolt-on sheet metal part. If a sheet metal replacement panel is welded, corrosion protection may be considered. Basic corrosion protection that is provided by the paint system and primer is an included refinish operation. Therefore, it should not be added to the repair estimate when replacing a bolt-on sheet metal part. It is important to consider that during some repair processes the factory corrosion protection may be disturbed on a portion of the panel the repair facility will not be refinishing. The application of a product, equivalent to a factory E-coat, to bare metal is not included in either the refinish or panel replacement labor. If a sheet metal replacement panel is welded, corrosion protection should be considered. The anti-corrosion compounds used during panel replacement are typically wax or petroleum-based and applied inside any enclosed section(s) of structural members. Weld-through primer is considered a form of anti-corrosion compound that is included in the CCC refinishing procedures for welded panels. A manual (Sublet) line entry for corrosion protection, coded at an SM (sheet metal) rate, should be entered with a dollar figure. When applicable ‐ any application of labor must be reasonable and well documented. Undercoating/Rust Proofing To be used only if the specific parts were previously treated Replacement Parts Usage Estimators should consider all approved alternative part(s) and make reasonable attempts to locate the most appropriate, cost-effective part(s) compliant when writing a repair estimate. Estimators must use their best judgment when searching for and utilizing alternative parts. Factors such as pricing, time constraints, part quality, and a number of suppliers, part location, and the cost-benefit analysis should be considered in their decisions. The outcome and the thought process behind the decision should be reasonably documented in the file. Recycled Parts Non-mechanical recycled parts have no year or mileage restriction. All recycled mechanical parts must be of the same year or newer. Engines and transmissions must also be of the same mileage or less. Recycled steering columns and seat assemblies may be used on vehicles. They may not be used if this part is mandated to be replaced with airbag deployment within the vehicle airbag matrix HNotes in CCC ONE. When using a recycled steering column all salvage airbag components and safety equipment must be removed from the customer&rsquo;s vehicle and reinstalled if undamaged or replaced with new OEM components. In the instance the customer&rsquo;s steering column is damaged and requires replacement, all components must be inspected upon removal for damages. If components are undamaged, we may install the old components onto the LKQ steering column. Recycled structural components are acceptable on unibody and full-frame estimates. The installation of two or more LKQ rail sections is not permitted in the repair of a vehicle. b. Full frame replacement should not be considered where state or local law requires title branding of the vehicle. With the exception of the following bullet points, recycled steering, brakes, airbags, seat belts, child safety seats, struts, shocks, and suspension will not be utilized. A recycled drive shaft or drive axle may be used provided the wearable components are replaced in accordance with our part usage policy. Recycled cradles, trailing axles, axle housings, control arms, and knuckles/spindles may be used provided all wearable components are transferred from the original assembly if undamaged or replaced with new (OE or Aftermarket) or remanufactured components. Recycled windshields will not be used. All other recycled glass is acceptable. Recycled windshield-mounted eyesight/safety cameras and sensors are not allowed Recycled cameras (reverse, front-facing, side, etc&hellip;) will not be used. Aftermarket Parts We guarantee that customers will be satisfied with the fit, finish, and corrosion resistance of aftermarket sheet metal and plastic parts specified in our vehicle repair estimates. This guarantee applies to the original repair for as long as the customer owns the vehicle. A certification, warranty, or guarantee must be provided by the part manufacturer/supplier and accompany the part. Only certified (CAPA, NSF, etc. ) or KeysIQ and LKQ Platinum Plus aftermarket parts may be utilized to replace exterior plastic (headlamps, tail lamps, side mirror housings, etc..), exterior sheet metal panels, crash parts, and radiator/core supports. These parts should be marked with the seal indicating the certification. No restriction on plastic parts not considered to be crash parts. Fender liners, grilles, fillers, moldings, skid plates, deflectors, etc.. &nbsp; All customers must be informed of the use of aftermarket parts included in the estimate before repairs begin. All state laws, requirements, and regulations must be met to secure written or verbal consent where applicable. We adhere to all state-specific restrictions and regulations governing the use of aftermarket parts. We will NOT: Write estimates using aftermarket structural components. Write estimates using aftermarket bumper reinforcement bars, bumper reinforcement components or welded in radiator supports on unibody vehicles. There is no restriction on foam bumper absorbers, bumper cover components (bumper cover clips, brackets, retainers, etc..) There is no restriction to bolt on radiator supports. There is no restriction to full-frame vehicles with welded-in core supports which are not considered structural. Write estimates using aftermarket exterior plastic parts (headlamps, tail lamps, side mirror housings), body panels and bumper covers in the following situations: Advanced Policies: Current or previous model year with mileage less than or equal to 24,000 miles Classic Policies: Current Model Year and equal to or less than 12,000 miles Other Policies: Current Model Year and equal to or less than 12,000 miles No restriction on mechanical (suspension parts, water pumps, etc..) or hard parts (radiators, exhaust, etc..). No restriction on plastic parts not considered to be crash parts. Fender liners, grilles, fillers, moldings, skid plates, deflectors, etc. Non-certified aftermarket parts will be allowed when they are replacing a previously installed noncertified aftermarket part or at the request of the customer. Example: Non-certified fender replaced with non-certified fender In those instances when an OEM part is on a long backorder or discontinued or not available aftermarket and repairing the original part is not an option, the estimate should reflect the price quoted by the system. Parts Policies &ndash; Remanufactured Except for safety-related or Supplemental Restraint Systems components, remanufactured parts are acceptable. Parts Policies- Gray Market Parts Gray Market OEM parts are manufactured according to specifications provided by the original vehicle manufacturer. They have been purchased from a foreign source that procured the part from foreign OEM authorized dealers and/or their subsidiaries. Certain OEM&rsquo;s do not recognize these parts as OEM parts as they are outside of their supply chains, recall processes, and warranties. Because there is no guarantee by the manufacturer or suppliers, gray market parts should not be considered a viable part option for repairs. There may be instances where exceptions to these part policies will be made based on the needs of the customer. These exceptions must be reasonable, well documented, and take into consideration customer safety, as well as comply with the terms of the insurance policy and state regulations and laws. Supplements Supplements will be handled in a timely manner and with the same diligence and proactive approach as the original inspection and estimate. All supplements must be completed in CCC ONE. Photos, invoices, etc. should be obtained to document and support the supplement. Estimates will contain the disclaimer that any and all supplements must have prior approval from the inspecting adjuster. The customer must be notified if the supplement will result in a change in the repair/replace decision(s) and the expected repair timeline or rental needs. Total Losses The major activities of the total loss valuation process include: A complete and accurate estimate of damages If a total loss is triggered Change the Primary Point of Impact as &ldquo;15 Total Loss&rdquo; in the Vehicle Tab in CCC ONE Conduct a detailed physical inspection of the loss vehicle in accordance with the current CCC Vehicle Condition Inspection Guidelines A minimum of 11 photos showing: Each corner of the loss vehicle &ndash; 4 photos Vehicle identification number (VIN ) &ndash; 1 photo Engine/Under-hood &ndash;1 photo Odometer (if not accessible, oil change sticker or service document) &ndash; 1 photo License plate &ndash; 1 photo Area of damage &ndash; number of photos necessary to clearly represent the damage &ndash; 2 photos minimum, taken at different angles Interior view driver's side frontal seating area, to include in the single photo the carpet, seat, and dash areas. &ndash; 1 photo Headliner --1 photo Additional interior and exterior photos as necessary for prior damage and abnormal condition. The purpose of vehicle photos is to capture the condition of the vehicle and support the comments and CCC Valuescope ratings. Estimate Administration Requirements: The following inputs must be correct, as they directly impact the vehicle&rsquo;s value: VIN, Year, Make, Model, Transmission, Mileage, Options and Date of Loss. When available, the factory build sheet should always be run in CCC ONE. Mileage should be entered as &ldquo;Actual&rdquo; even when it is estimated based on invoices or other supporting documents. It is an expectation to obtain supporting documentation when an odometer reading is not able to be obtained, and the mileage is estimated from service records or other sources. Mileage should never be entered as &ldquo;Not Actual&rdquo; or &ldquo;Non-Readable&rdquo;. Zero miles should never be used. Rate the vehicle condition relative to each CCC condition definition and provide vehicle-specific comments within CCC Valuescope in the space provided for each category. Comments should include what the condition is, where the condition is located, and the size of the condition observed. Any unrelated prior damage written for that category is also documented here. Documentation must be clear and concise. An Unrelated Prior damage estimate is to be written whenever an observed condition falls below the parameters on the CCC Vehicle Condition Inspection Guidelines applicable to the loss vehicle. A complete and accurate UPD estimate needs to be written in accordance with industry standards taking into consideration all repair processes and alternative parts. Identify enhancements or after-market customizations. Collect available supporting documentation and enter the appropriate information on the CCC Basic Claim Information Form.

Obviously, detailed interior and exterior photos are needed so the Progressive group can prepare ACV work-ups as needed. A thorough accounting of obvious prior nonstorm related damages as well. LOUISIANA AUTO ONLY (TOTAL LOSS): This is the only state we utilize NADA. When determining a vehicle is a total loss, when possible please complete a pre-existing damage estimate and run a NADA report &nbsp;based on date of loss month, this will be helpful in expediting our settlements. ALL OTHER STATES (TOTAL LOSS): We just need pictures of the interior and mechanical for our in-house evaluation report no further action is needed from the vendor. FLOOD: Any flood that has Salt or Brackish Water, inside the vehicles in the carpet, are an automatic total loss. Any car with water (Fresh Water -Salt is already a total) up to the dash is an Obvious Total Loss. They just need to complete an estimate with dollar amounts noting the vehicle is an Obvious Total Loss, NADA report (Louisiana only)and applicable pictures /PED estimate, if present. WIND: For Wind, Cars that require replacement of two structural components, front clip, rear clip, or Roof, are obvious total losses. Any vehicle that rolls over is an obvious total loss. &nbsp; Photos and Scope HE/Specialty There is a special Crawford scope sheet for HE/Specialty vehicles that is attached in the file for you that needs to be completely filled out top to bottom. HE/Specialty needs the Correct ID sheet completed along with the scope sheet and it is also attached in the file for you and needs to be completely filled out top to bottom.

Take LOTS of photos, Odometer, options, engine, trans, wheels, axels, hours, any and all stickers on the vehicle, measured photos, tire make, sizes, and tread depth and Registration, the more info the better. &nbsp; Full Auto Appraisal Assignments: ALL FULL APPRAISAL ASSIGNMENTS will have specific guidelines per carrier noted otherwise use below. Crawford standard handling guidelines: Automated estimating platform. Like, Kind and Quality parts will be considered on any vehicle over one year of age or in excess of 15,000 miles.&nbsp; If no parts are available, a comment to that effect must be included in the appraiser&rsquo;s report. We will not utilize LKQ for safety-related items such as suspension, brakes, steering, and SRS components After Market parts will be considered on any vehicle over one year of age or in excess of 15,000 miles.&nbsp; If no parts are available, a comment must be included in the appraiser&rsquo;s report. Only CAPA certified sheet metal parts. No sectioning of front or rear assemblies. Betterment will be considered, based on visible and documented wear. Wheel alignments will be considered when there is damage to a suspension part, wheel, or tire. An agreed price on all repairable vehicles currently at a shop. Crawford requires a special closing report to be completed for all estimates and they have one for supplements, both are located in the forms section of the assignment and in the Docs and Photos section. Closing reports must have EVERY line and section addressed, which includes the ACV and percentage of repair to ACV (use NADA and attach the printout from NADA).&nbsp; Repair days by Crawford are -- Repair hours divided by 4= Repair days and your name, email, and claim number at the top of the report. We do not need the claim summary in CCC1 or Claimleader report filled out due to using the Crawford ones, please save yourself time and only complete the Crawford report form required. Need to use Crawford Vehicle Services Header on your estimate, the drop-down to do this is located in the ""Contacts"" tab of CCC1 and is called ""IA Company"" Do not list Crawford as the insurance company. Photos need to be labeled and require the same photos as a photos-only inspection listed above. &nbsp; For Auto Claimco Full Assignments Please note for this client that no total loss valuation is required as this is a Canadian client. All we need is an accurate appraisal, proper accounting of any prior damages, and thorough options. You should still notate if you feel the vehicle is a total loss. Mileage may be listed as Kilometers and not Mileage, please be sure to confirm which and list as the mileage on the estimate. If you have a total loss, a total loss workup is not required, but please list salvage bids as the client has no contacts in the US. You can list them in the closing report comment section. &nbsp; Total Losses (See Threshold Guide for your states %): Please note that Crawford &amp; Company requires a JD Power/NADA value print out on every repairable vehicle.&nbsp; If the cost of repairs is at 70% or above, then proceed to run a CCC Market Evaluation. &nbsp; CCC ID is 93684&nbsp; Office is Crawford &nbsp; You may have noticed the merger of NADA and J.D. Power when going to one of the NADA websites.&nbsp; When you go to NADA.com or NADAguides.com, you are redirected to the jdpower.com site. &nbsp; The jdpower.com site has a different look and feel than the prior NADA sites.&nbsp; Also, the jdpower.com site provides different types of values depending on the age of the vehicle in question.&nbsp; For consistency, we will use the following values from the jdpower.com site: * For vehicles that are 19 years old and newer, we will use the &ldquo;Buy from Dealer, Average Price Paid&rdquo; * For vehicles that are 20 years old and older, we will use the &ldquo;Average Retail&rdquo; Total losses have a special form attached in the forms section of the assignment that needs to be filled out COMPLETELY and attached with a NADA printout failure to do so will result in a revision. Please make sure to print out your Comps used for the market search on the report and attach to the file as well. The suggested ACV on the Total Loss form is Book + Market divided by 2= ACV.

PLEASE COMPLETE CCC TL FORM ONLY!!!! PRE-REPAIR and POST-REPAIR OEM DIAGNOSTIC SCANNING: To the extent that the OEM repair procedures and/or manufacturer positional statements require, necessitate, or recommend pre-repair and post-repair diagnostics scans, those scans should be authorized and included as separate line items on the estimate. When pre-repair and post-repair scans are included in the estimate and/or supplement, the shop is required to provide the supporting paperwork showing the results of the scans. The appraiser is then required to submit those to Mutual Benefit with the appraisal and/or supplement. If the pre-repair and post-repair scans were sublet to another facility, invoices are required and must be submitted to Mutual Benefit. SUPPLEMENT HANDLING Any supplement request by the repair shop must be verified by the appraiser. Verification should include: Personal inspection (within 24 hours of notification from shop) Additional appraisal photos Copies of invoices At this time, the appraiser will also check the repairs to verify if they were completed in accordance with our appraisal. If they were not, the supplement will be deducted according to the repairs that were performed. If additional straightening labor is requested, an additional inspection must be performed BEFORE REPAIRS ARE MADE. Re-inspections are not required on single item issues or parts price increases. No supplemental payment can be issued without this additional estimate and supporting photographs and/or invoices. AUTHORITY TO REPAIR Do not, under any circumstances, authorize a shop to make repairs. The vehicle owner alone must authorize repairs at the shop of their choice. Should the owner request names of quality repairers, the appraiser should direct the vehicle owner back to the adjuster who can give them a list of direct repair options to choose from if desired. &nbsp; AGREED PRICE The completed appraisal should be reviewed with the shop owner or manager and the appraiser should attempt to secure as an agreed price. Note the appraisal as to the agreed figure and with whom it was obtained. If, after negotiations, you are unable to reach an agreed upon price please contact the adjuster to advise and to get further direction. TOTAL LOSSES A total loss must be determined after an appraisal has been completed. Estimates should be written to the extent of the Actual Cash Value. (Exceptions to written appraisals may be complete burnouts and complete floods up to and including the dash.) The appraiser will establish the value of the total loss according to a CCC evaluation. This CCC evaluation should be completed and submitted by the appraiser according to state statute. Additional charge for submitting a CCC should be shown in the appraisal invoice. This should be submitted under the MBG Office ID#s: Maryland: 24270 Pennsylvania: 22733 Make sure to have the TL sales tax selected and the rate at 6% for the state of PA and in Philadelphia only it is 7% Make sure to have the Deductible added when calling in the CCC valuation. Make sure to have the UPD added to the valuation when calling in.&nbsp; The CCC data information sheet, along with CCC reference number, should be included with the appraisal. MBG staff will pull the CCC valuation from the CCC website. All prior and unrelated damage should be taken into consideration. A separate appraisal must be written for any prior or unrelated damage. If the damages in question result from an accident with multiple impacts points, it may be necessary to write each point of impact as a separate appraisal, in effect splitting the damages into 2 or more estimates of repair. The assigned inside adjuster will notify the appraiser if this is required. STATE APPROVED VALUE GUIDES Pennsylvania: Accurate Audatex (formerly ADP Claims Solutions) Autobid Automobile Red Book CCC Mitchell International NADA Vehicle Valuation Services PA Bulletin Approved Guide Source Vendors 8.28.2017 2. Maryland: NADA CCC Sec. 31.15.12.04.&nbsp;of MD code &ldquo;nationally recognized valuation manual or from a computerized data base that produces statistically valid fair market values for a substantially similar vehicle &nbsp; TOWING/STORAGE Towing and daily storage rates should be identified on the appraisal if applicable. When applicable, the start date of storage should be documented. Copies and/or photos of all towing, storage, and advanced charges invoices are required and should be included with the appraisal report. &nbsp; ARSON, FIRE AND SUSPICIOUS CLAIMS The appraiser will likely be the first insurance company representative to see the damaged vehicle or equipment. An experienced appraiser will spot suspicious damage during the initial inspection. The appraiser may also spot suspicious causes of damage including origin or extent of fire damage. The appraiser should make a thorough inspection of anything suspicious without disturbing the evidence or altering any part of the vehicle. Good, clear photographs should be taken of any suspicious areas. The appraiser should immediately telephone the adjuster and/or the Special Investigation Unit in the home office and relay the information as accurately as possible. The appraiser should avoid using such words as &ldquo;arson&rdquo; or &ldquo;criminal,&rdquo; etc. Instead, words such as &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; or incendiary&rdquo; should be used. The appraiser will not make any comments to the insured, claimant, or repair shop regarding his suspicions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; PREVAILING RATES If a repair shop refuses to work at the established area rate or if an increase in the regular labor rate is requested, contact the adjuster for further instructions. Requests such as these will be handled differently in some areas and possibly on a case by case basis. Once the procedure is established in your area, subsequent cases may be handled accordingly. &nbsp; LIKE, KIND &amp; QUALITY PARTS Current model year &ndash; NO LKQ parts Previous model year - *MUST consider LKQ or something similar* The policy contract is very specific in defining the company&rsquo;s liability in reference to the repair or to the replacement of the entire vehicle. Used parts of like, kind, and quality should be utilized in the repair and/or replacement of nonfunctional sheet metal parts whenever practical and when the parts are available. These parts must be serviceable and, in a condition, regarding fit and performance, that is equal to or better than what the owner had prior to the loss. In this respect, the appraiser should have prior knowledge of the type and condition of the merchandise that a salvage yard has for sale. If LKQ parts are not available, the appraiser must indicate why on the report and list the salvage yards that were contacted. If LKQ parts are found, include their name, sales representative, phone number, cost, and mark-up on your report. The following policy on certain repair and replacement procedures must be adhered to: We do not sanction the replacement of any complete Body Assemblies. (i.e. front or rear clips). All Suspension and Steering Components, including brakes that are damaged and warrant replacement, must be replaced with Original Manufacturer Equipment (OEM) Parts. NO USED or A/M COMPONENTS. &nbsp; AFTER MARKET PARTS Current model year &ndash; NO After-market parts Previous model year - *HARD (non-sheet metal) after-market parts* It is our policy to provide the owner with a guarantee on all after-market parts utilized on our repair estimates. The guarantee should be for quality equal to or exceeding the original equipment for as long as they own the vehicle. We will use after-market exterior sheet-metal parts, including hoods, fenders, doors, trunk lids, rear panels, quarter panels, bumper covers, and bumper reinforcement bars on vehicles three years or older. These parts must be CAPA certified parts and marked as such on the appraisal. Hard after-market parts are those parts considered non-sheet metal. Grilles, headlight assemblies, AC condensers, radiators, bumper absorbers, shocks, batteries, etc. are considered non-sheet metal parts. Exception: All state legislation and regulations are to be followed for any after-market parts. Note that Pennsylvania and Maryland do not require prior consent from the owner. &nbsp; PLASTIC REPAIRS Bumpers, covers, inner fender wells, grilles, radiators, fan shrouds, dash panels or any other thermo plastic components should be hot air welded whenever reasonable. This repair is as permanent as the original material. The net result is a substantial cost savings without sacrificing quality. &nbsp; REFINISHING MATERIAL ALLOWANCE Refinish material allowance should be established in each individual area. &nbsp; STANDARD PASSENGER TIRES All standard first-line passenger car tires have a thread depth of 11/32&rdquo; when new. No betterment charges will be applied for the first 1/32&rdquo;. When the tread measures less than 10/32&rdquo;, betterment charges at a rate of ten percent (10%) for each 1/32&rdquo; wear should be applied. Use a tire tread depth gauge to measure tire wear. Indicate it on the appraisal. If the damaged tire has no tread left at all the value of the tire must be established and a settlement made on a cash allowance basis. Some premium tires have a tread depth of 13/32&rdquo; and depreciation should be considered accordingly. &nbsp; PAINT Betterment should be considered only when a complete paint job is allowed or when the damaged panel has a primer on it. Basic paint life should be figured from 10% to 15% per year, based on an average life of 7 to 10 years. Factors in determining the average life of a paint job would depend on the type of finish (clear coat vs. basic color coat application). Also, take it to consideration that if the auto has been garaged for most of its life, the life expectancy of the paint will have to be adjusted accordingly. &nbsp; DEPRECIATION/BETTERMENT SCHEDULE Since the company&rsquo;s maximum liability, as stated in the policy, is for actual cash value at the time of the loss, and since property depreciates in its value with use, the company is entitled to make a reasonable charge to an insured or claimant based on the increased value of the vehicle resulting from repairs and replacements. Depreciation and/or betterment should be applied based on the life expectancies listed below. This list is not all inclusive. All items that are subject to depreciation should be listed on the appraisal with the actual cost and the amount of the depreciation being applied. The betterment total should be included in the estimate total and entries section of the appraisal. The maximum depreciation and/or betterment taken is 50%. OLD DAMAGE/RUST OUT The cost to repair the rust damage area must be established (labor, tax, and materials.) This amount must be deducted from the cost to replace the part. Betterment should not exceed 70% of the replacement part in these instances. &nbsp; APPEARANCE ALLOWANCES Consideration can be given to making dollar allowances on minor damage to items such as bumpers, grilles, moldings, etc., in lieu of repairs. These allowances should be noted separately on the estimate and should not be included in the total agreed price. NOTE: Some of the procedures and policies outlined here may conflict with certain state laws or regulations. If this is the case in your area, disregard the conflicting information and follow your local requirements, laws, or regulations.

Photos must be labeled, clear, and include Keson rod measured photos of the damage. Please make sure to document all options on the vehicle with photos if you believe the vehicle could be a total loss, this is very important.&nbsp; CSO&nbsp;Assignments: Instructions from AIG Management When the assignment states the customer has the CSO policy, this means that the customer has the option to repair or not repair their vehicle when the estimate reaches 50% of the AGREED VALUE NOT THE ACV. &nbsp;For example; if you write an estimate for $10,000 and the AGREED VALUE is $20,000, then the customer has the option to choose to repair or not repair based on the AGREED VALUE. &nbsp;Once you reach 50% of the AGREED VALUE, inform the shop that you need to check coverage with the carrier and advise them not to order parts and don&rsquo;t do a tear down until instructed. Do not tell the shop about the 50% option, this is for our information only. &nbsp;Do not release the estimate and contact the adjuster or myself for guidance. If your estimate is at 40% with the CSO but you think maybe the supplement will put it over 50%, you need to call me. &nbsp;Please do not tag the vehicle as a total loss, it is repairable, but make sure your notes indicate the vehicle has reached the 50% threshold of the AGREED VALUE and look for guidance from our adjuster or myself. &nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t confuse this with vehicles that may be written at 50% but are considered a constructive total loss! Applies only to repairable vehicles If your estimate reaches 50% of the AGREED VALUE or close on repairable vehicles, do not leave an estimate copy with the shop and contact the adjuster. Direct the shop to not order parts or do not start any repairs or tear downs without our direction Do not discuss with the shop the policy terms for CSO Do not tag a vehicle as a total loss Document the estimate has reached the 50% of the AGREED VALUE based on the CSO policy Contact the adjuster or me for direction TOTAL LOSSES (75%Threshold) Write an estimate for unrelated damage (do not include typical wear and tear).&nbsp; Run the valuation in CCC1 under the total loss tab, make sure all the correct options are selected in the vehicle tab. Obtain all advance and storage charges on the vehicle. Contact claims rep with the above info including claim number. Leave a voicemail with info if unable to contact rep.
