<p>Please find attached the estimate, photos, and our invoice. This vehicle is not a total loss, both shops estimates were either over written or missing things. The estimate attached is a combination of both estimates basically. The damages are pretty self-explanatory, and I don't anticipate much of a supplement, maybe part price increases and a bracket or something. I met with the customer and really smoothed things over and I know she was upset but i believe she is good now, she showed me around her cow milking facility which was pretty cool. lol Please let us know if there is anything else you need.

<p>This is going to be a possible total loss. Attached please find the supplement, photos and valuations. CCC had this at 95% threshold so I ran the valuation. Currently it is at 67% but has not been torn down. It is still with the customer actually. The shop sent in a sup for part price changes and labor rate increase. There is a good chance there will be more hidden damage found and misc items the shop will add to a supplement that would end up pushing this over the threshold. I told the shop that I turned this into you all for a possible TL review so that they pause on getting this in and torn down.&nbsp; Please let us know if you need anything else.

The Roof panel repair, LR door on the outer panel, and both LT and RT fenders are all UPD. 

If you do not agree with that, then the customer will need to speak with the insurance company to see if they will allow that to be added to the claim. 

At this time, the only damage is to the LT apt panel above the rear door from someone trying to pry the door open. Not the dents in the other panels. 

Also, You have to R&amp;I the rear seats and to pull back the carpet&hellip;.. Is there a reason for that? There are no repairs being done to the qtr panel or the rocker so I don&rsquo;t see why this would be needed? 

At this time, there isn&rsquo;t a supplement unless the insurance company determines they will cover the UPD as part of this claim. 

I attached the adjuster as well so she is aware of the situation.

I replied to the assignments@claimleader.com email address however it got kicked back because it&rsquo;s a non monitored email.  I just called and left a message as well.  

The claims will not be combined into one for estimating purposes.  Please have the complete estimate written up for this claims repairs and I will review the information against the other claims to determine overlap and discuss potential changes.
